## Expressions

In algebra, we use letters like ${x,}$ ${y,}$ ${n,}$ and ${m}$ to represent some object (e.g., numbers). These letters are called **variables**. When we combine these variables with mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.), we obtain an **expression**. For example, the following are all expressions:

$$
    a + 2 \\[1em]
    x^2 \\[1em]
    \dfrac{x^{1/3} + y}{xy}
$$

Of course, expressions need not have variables. These are expressions, too:

$$
    1 + 1 \\[1em]
    2/3 \\[1em]
    \pi
$$

When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we have an equation. This is just a symbolic way of saying, "These two expressions are the same." Here is a rather famous one:

$$
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
$$

## The Domain of an Expression

All mathematical expressions have a **domain** â€“ the set of all values for which the expression is defined. For example, in the expression ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2,}$ we assume the expression is defined for real numbers. That is, it only makes sense if we plug real numbers into the variables. It would not make sense if the domain included, say, dogs. Of course, it very well could, but we'd have to define what it means to square and add dogs:

$$
    \text{rottweiler}^2 + \text{greyhound}^2 = \text{mastiff}^2.
$$

The point is, outside the expression's domain, the expression is undefined.

> **Definition.** Given an expression ${u,}$ the notation
>
> $$
>    \text{dom}(u)
> $$
>
> denotes the domain of ${u.}$

**_example_**. In the expression ${1/((t-1)(t-3)),}$ we define the domain to be all real numbers (${\reals}$), not including ${1}$ and not including ${-3.}$ If we let ${t = 1}$ or ${t = -3,}$ then we have a zero denominator. And as we all know, we cannot divide by zero.

$$
    \text{dom} \left( \dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)} \right) = \set{t \in \reals | t \neq 1, t \neq -3}.
$$

## Solution Sets

Because an expression may contain variables, an equation is true or false only if we substitute values into those variables. Until then, the equation is neither true nor false. If a value is substituted and the equation is true, we call that value the **solution**, or **root**, of the equation. The set of all roots to an equation is called the equation's **truth set** or **solution set**.

If the equation's solution set is the equation's domain, we call the equation an
**identity**.

**_example_**. ${x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3).}$

**_example_**. ${\dfrac{x^2}{x} = x.}$

## Number Sets

For the purposes of calculus, it suffices to give informal definitions of numbers.

<aside>
  Thorough definitions of the naturals and integers are typically presented in a
  set theory course; the rationals, irrationals, and reals in a real analysis
  course; and the complex numbers in a linear algebra course.
</aside>

> **Definition (informal): Real Numbers.** A real number is any number that can be expressed in decimal form. We denote the set of real numbers with the symbol ${\reals.}$

The real numbers can be represented as points on a _number line_. A fundamental fact: There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of real numbers and the set of points on a line. For each given point, the real number associated with that point is called the point's **coordinate**.

![Real Line](https://res.cloudinary.com/sublimis/image/upload/v1653361169/math/number_line_rbz14e.svg)

The naturals are the most basic numbers. These are the numbers we use for counting.

> **Definition (informal): Natural Numbers.** A natural number is any number of the set ${\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}.}$ We denote this set with the symbol ${\N.}$

The naturals with the negative numbers comprise the set of integers.

> **Definition (informal): Integers.** An integer is any number of the set ${\{ \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}.}$ We denote this set with the symbol ${\Z.}$

As its name suggests, a rational number is any number that can be written as the ratio of two integers.

> **Definition (informal): Rational Numbers.** Let ${a \in \Z}$ and let ${b \in \Z.}$ Then a rational number is any number of the form ${a/b.}$ We denote the set of all such numbers with the symbol ${\mathbb{Q}.}$

Any number that does not satisfy the definition of rational numbers is called an irrational number.

> **Definition (informal): Irrational Numbers.** Let ${x}$ be some number. If ${x \notin \mathbb{Q},}$ then ${x}$ is an irrational number.

Examples of irrational numbers include ${\sqrt{2},}$ ${\pi,}$ and Euler's number ${e.}$ None of these numbers can be written as a ratio of integers.

## Relations

In mathematics, a **relation** is the definition of some relationship between mathematical objects. We can relate one real to another in terms of their position on the real line. For example, viewing the real line, we can say that ${0}$ is "to the left" of ${1,}$ or, more succinctly, ${0 \lt 1.}$ We can talk about the reals in terms of their relations to other reals because of the fact that the real numbers are _ordered_: ${2}$ comes after ${1,}$ ${3}$ comes after ${2,}$ ${0}$ comes before ${1,}$ ${\pi}$ comes before ${4,}$ etc.

| Notation     | Definition                               | Example                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ${a \lt b}$  | ${a}$ is less than ${b.}$                | ${0 \lt 1.}$                |
| ${a \leq b}$ | ${a}$ is less than or equal to ${b.}$    | ${1 \leq 1,}$ ${0 \leq 1.}$ |
| ${a \gt b}$  | ${a}$ is greater than ${b.}$             | ${1 \gt 0.}$                |
| ${a \geq b}$ | ${a}$ is greater than or equal to ${b.}$ | ${1 \gt 1, 1 \gt 0.}$       |

## Intervals

When we work with ${\reals,}$ we often want to talk about sections of the real line (or, in terms of set theory, subsets of ${\reals}$). These sections, or subsets, can be defined in terms of intervals.

> **Definition.** The open interval ${(a,b)}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \lt x \lt b.}$ The closed interval ${[a,b]}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \leq x \leq b.}$ The left-inclusive interval ${[a,b)}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \leq x \lt b.}$ The right-inclusive interval ${(a,b]}$ consits of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \lt x \leq b.}$

In some cases, we may want talk about a subset of the reals that extends indefinitely in some direction. Such subsets are called **unbounded intervals**.

| Notation              | Inequality   |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| ${(a, \infty)}$       | ${x \gt a}$  |
| ${[a, \infty)}$       | ${x \geq a}$ |
| ${(-\infty, a)}$      | ${x \lt a}$  |
| ${(-\infty, a]}$      | ${x \leq a}$ |
| ${(-\infty, \infty)}$ |              |

## Absolute Value

For some problems, we want to think about how far a given real number ${x}$ is from ${0.}$ The operator for computing this distance is the _absolute value_.

> **Definition: Absolute Value.** Given ${x \in \reals,}$ the absolute value of ${x,}$ denoted ${| x |,}$ is defined as:
>
> $$
>     | x | = \begin{cases}
>     -x & \text{if} ~ x \lt 0 \\
>     x & \text{else}
>     \end{cases}.
> $$

**_example_**. ${|6 - 7| = |-1| = 1.}$

Given that real numbers can be interpreted as points on a number line, the distance between two real numbers is the absolute value of their difference. 

> __Property.__ Given ${a, b \in \R,}$ the distance between ${a}$ and ${b}$ is ${\vert a - b \vert = \vert b - a \vert.}$

Below are some additional properties of the absolute value.

| Property                                                                       | Comment                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ${\vert x \vert \geq 0}$                                                       | Absolute values are always nonnegative.                               |
| ${x \leq \vert x \vert}$                                                       |                                                                       |
| ${-x \leq \vert x \vert}$                                                      |                                                                       |
| ${\vert x \vert^2 = x^2}$                                                      |                                                                       |
| ${\sqrt{x^2} = \vert x \vert}$                                                 |                                                                       |
| ${\vert ab \vert = \vert a \vert \vert b \vert}$                               |                                                                       |
| ${\left\vert \dfrac{a}{b} \right\vert = \dfrac{\vert a \vert}{\vert b \vert}}$ | ${b \neq 0}$                                                          |
| ${\vert a + b \vert \leq \vert a \vert + \vert b \vert}$                       | This is a rather famous property, called the **triangle inequality**. |

## Equations
We now examine equations. Recall that an equation is a special type of mathematical statement. Specifically, one that claims: "The expression on the left of the "${=}$" is the same, in every way, as the expression on the right of the "${=.}$"

__*example*__. ${a = b}$ means "${a}$ is the same, in every way, as ${b.}$" 

When equations contain variables, they belong to a type of mathematical statement called an __open sentence__ &mdash; a statement that contains one or more variables, and becomes a proposition when each variable is substituted with an element from the expression's domain. For example, the equation ${a = b}$ is true when ${a = 1}$ and ${b = 1,}$ but false when ${a = 0}$ and ${b = 1.}$ 

When a value is substituted for a variable in an equation such that the equation is true, we say that the value __satisfies__ the equation, and that the value is a __solution__ to the equation. When two equations have the exact same set of solutions, we say that the two equations are __equivalent__. A common procedure in algebra is solving for a given variable. This is done by writing a sequence of equivalent equations until we get to the form ${\text{variable} = \text{constant}}$ (e.g., ${x = 1}$ or ${z = \pi}$).

The following principles apply to generating equivalent equations:

1. Adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of an equation produces an equivalent equation. 
2. Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by the same nonzero quantity produces an equivalent equation. 
3. Simplifying an expression on either side of an equation produces an equivalent equation.

Equations &mdash; and more generally, expressions &mdash; are simply succinct ways of expressing sentences that would otherwise be too cumbersome to write by prose. For example, consider the following sentence:

- The integral with respect to ${z}$ from zero to three point eight of the quotient of the product of the fourth power of Pi, ${x,}$ and ${y}$ multiplied by the sum of ${a,}$ the product of eight, ${b,}$ and the cosine of the quotient of the product of Pi and ${z}$ divided by ${l,}$ the product of eighteen, ${c,}$ and the cosine of the quotient of two, Pi, and ${z,}$ and the square of the sine of the quotient of Pi and ${z}$ divided by ${l,}$ all divided by the the fourth power of ${l.}$

This mouthful can be _expressed_ as:

$$
	\int_0^{3.8}\frac{\pi^4 x y (a+9 c+8 b \cos(\frac{\pi z}{l})+18 c \cos(\frac{2 \pi z}{l})) \sin^2(\frac{\pi z}{l})}{l^4} dz.
$$

## Families of Expressions
When we examine the variety of expressions found in mathematics, we find that certain groups of expressions share similiar patterns and properties. To try and organize this vast variety, we will organize these expressions into _families of expressions_, or _kinds of expressions_. 

### Linear Expressions
The simplest family of expressions is the __linear expression in one variable__. As simple as such expressions are, many real world problems can be reduced to linear expressions, or more specifically, linear equations.

<aside>

Complex problems can be reduced to _systems of linear equations_. Analyzing these systems is a key topic in the study of [linear algebra](/pages/linear-algebra). 

</aside>

> __Definition.__ A linear expression in one variable is an expression that can be written in the form 
>
> $$
>    ax + b,
> $$
>
> where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$

In the definition above, we call the expressions ${ax}$ and ${b}$ the __terms__ &mdash; or, more generally, the __subexpressions__ &mdash; of the linear expression.

### Monomial Expressions
The terms of a linear expression are themselves a special type of expression called __monomial expressions__. The simplest monomial expression is the __univariate monomial expression__, or the __monomial expression in one variable__.

> __Definition.__ Let ${u}$ be an expression. We say that ${u}$ is a _univariate monomial expression_ in a single variable ${x}$ if ${u}$ satisfies one of the following rules:
>
> 1. ${u}$ is an integer or fraction.
> 2. ${u = x.}$
> 3. ${u = x^n,}$ where ${n \in \Z}$ and ${n \gt 1.}$
> 4. ${u}$ is a product with two operands that satisfies either (1), (2), or (3).

### Quadratic Expressions
> __Definition.__ A quadratic expression in one variable is an expression that can be written in the form 
>
> $$
>    ax^2 + bx + c,
> $$
>
> with ${a,b,c \in \reals}$ and ${a \neq 0.}$

The following property is often useful to solving quadratic equations:

> __Property.__ ${pq = 0}$ if and only if ${p = 0}$ or ${q = 0.}$

#### The Quadratic Formula
We can also solve quadratic equations directly with the quadratic formula:

> __Formula.__ The solutions of the quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0,}$ are given by
>
> $$
>    x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
> $$

### Polynomial Expressions
Quadratic expressions can be generalized as polynomial expressions in one variable. I.e., they are a specific type of polynomial expression in one variable. 

> __Definition.__ A polynomial ${u}$ in one variable is an expression of the form:
>
> $$
>    u_nx^n + u_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + u_1x + u_0,
> $$
>
> where the coefficients ${u_j}$ are rational numbers, and ${n}$ is a non-negative integer.

If ${u_n \neq 0,}$ we call ${u_n}$ the __leading coefficient__ of ${u}$ and ${n}$ the __degree__ of ${u.}$ The expression ${u = 0}$ is called the __zero polynomial__. By convention, the zero polynomial has leading coefficient ${0}$ and, according to mathematical convention, has degree ${-\infty.}$

To aid our discussion on polynomials, we define the following operators. 

> __Definition.__ Let ${u}$ be a polynomial expression in a single variable ${x.}$ Then:
>
> $$
>    \text{deg}(u,x) 
> $$
>
> corresponds to the degree of ${u}$ and
>
> $$
>    \text{lc}(u,x)
> $$
>
> corresponds to the leading coefficient of ${u.}$ If the variable ${x}$ is clear from context, we use the shorthand notation ${\text{deg}(u)}$ and ${\text{lc}(u).}$

 
## Cartesian Plane
The __Cartesian plane__ is a plane constructed from two perpendicular real lines, called __axes__. The horizontal line is called the ${x}$-axis, and the vertical line is called the ${y}$-axis. If we place a point ${p}$ on this plane, then that point can be represented as a pair ${(x_p,y_p),}$ where ${x_p}$ is the point's coordinate on the ${x}$-axis and ${y_p}$ is the point's coordinate on the ${y}$-axis.  

import {Calc1} from '@/components/Fig';

<Calc1/>

The point of intersection of the two axes is called the __origion__, usually denoted by the letter ${O.}$ The plane is divided into four regions called __quadrants__, often labeled ${\text{I}}$ through ${\text{IV}.}$

The pair ${(x_p, y_p)}$ is an example of an __ordered pair__. We call the coordinate ${x_p}$ the ordered pair's __abscissa__ and ${y_p}$ the __ordinate__. For brevity, the notation ${p(x, y)}$ means that the point ${p}$ has the coordinates ${(x,y).}$ 

### The Distance Between Two Points
Suppose we're given two points ${P(x_P, y_P)}$ and ${Q(x_Q, y_Q).}$ We want to know the distance between these two points. For example, in the diagram below, what is the length of the red line between the red dots?

import {DistanceBetweenPoints} from '@/components/Fig';

<DistanceBetweenPoints/>

We can solve this problem by employing one of the oldest theorems in mathematics:

> __Pythagorean Theorem.__ In a right triangle, the lengths of the sides are related by the equation
>
> $$
>    a^2 + b^2 = c^2,
> $$
>
> where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are the lengths of the sides forming the right triangle and ${c}$ is the length of the hyptonuse (the side opposite the right angle).

So, if we suppose that the red line in our diagram is ${c,}$ then the length of that line is found by solving for ${c:}$ 

$$
    c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$

But what are ${a}$ and ${b}$? They must be the lengths of the other sides of the right triangle:


import {DistanceBetweenPoints2} from '@/components/Fig';

<DistanceBetweenPoints2/>

Thus, we have the following formula. 

> __Distance Formula__. The distance ${d}$ between points ${(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${(x_2, y_2)}$ is given by
> 
> $$
>    d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.
> $$

### Midpoint Formula
Given two points ${P(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${Q(x_2, y_2),}$ what is the midpoint of the line segment joining ${P}$ and ${Q}$? For example, consider the figure below. The midpoint is marked by the red point. What is the coordinate of this point?

import {MidpointFig} from '@/components/Fig';

<MidpointFig/>

Here, we apply the midpoint formula:

> __Midpoint Formula__. Given points ${P(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${Q(x_2, y_2),}$ the midpoint of the line segment joining ${P}$ and ${Q}$ has the coordinates:
>
> $$
>    \left( \dfrac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right).
> $$

## Real Functions
We now turn our attention towards the _real functions_ &mdash; functions with the signature ${A \to B,}$ where ${A \subseteq \reals}$ and ${B \subseteq \reals.}$ 

### Affine Functions
In the sea of real functions, affine functions are among the most desirable. They're easy to understand because they're easy to gut &mdash; internally, they have at most two operations: multiplication and addition. 

> __Definition.__ Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are real number constants. A function of the form
>
> $$
>    f(x) = Ax + B
> $$
>
> is called an _affine function_. In the case where ${A = 0,}$ then ${f(x) = B,}$ and we call ${f}$ a _constant function_. In the case where ${B = 0}$ and ${A \neq 0,}$ then ${f(x) = Ax,}$ and we call ${f}$ a _linear function_.  

The graph of an affine function ${f}$ is a continuous straight line. If ${A \gt 0,}$ then ${f}$ is strictly increasing. If ${A \lt 0,}$ then ${f}$ is strictly decreasing. If ${A \neq 0,}$ then then ${f}$ has a unique zero ${x = -\dfrac{B}{A}.}$  

To demonstrate these facts, consider the interactive figure below. Adjust the ${A}$ and ${B}$ values to see what happens to our line. 

import {AffineFunctionLab} from "@/components/Fig";

    return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>
