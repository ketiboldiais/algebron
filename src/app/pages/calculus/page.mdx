## Expressions

In algebra, we use letters like ${x,}$ ${y,}$ ${n,}$ and ${m}$ to represent some object (e.g., numbers). These letters are called **variables**. When we combine these variables with mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.), we obtain an **expression**. For example, the following are all expressions:

$$
    a + 2 \\[1em]
    x^2 \\[1em]
    \dfrac{x^{1/3} + y}{xy}
$$

Of course, expressions need not have variables. These are expressions, too:

$$
    1 + 1 \\[1em]
    2/3 \\[1em]
    \pi
$$

When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we have an equation. This is just a symbolic way of saying, "These two expressions are the same." Here is a rather famous one:

$$
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
$$

## The Domain of an Expression

All mathematical expressions have a **domain** ‚Äì the set of all values for which the expression is defined. For example, in the expression ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2,}$ we assume the expression is defined for real numbers. That is, it only makes sense if we plug real numbers into the variables. It would not make sense if the domain included, say, dogs. Of course, it very well could, but we'd have to define what it means to square and add dogs:

$$
    \text{rottweiler}^2 + \text{greyhound}^2 = \text{mastiff}^2.
$$

The point is, outside the expression's domain, the expression is undefined.

> **Definition.** Given an expression ${u,}$ the notation
>
> $$
>    \text{dom}(u)
> $$
>
> denotes the domain of ${u.}$

**_example_**. In the expression ${1/((t-1)(t-3)),}$ we define the domain to be all real numbers (${\reals}$), not including ${1}$ and not including ${-3.}$ If we let ${t = 1}$ or ${t = -3,}$ then we have a zero denominator. And as we all know, we cannot divide by zero.

$$
    \text{dom} \left( \dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)} \right) = \set{t \in \reals | t \neq 1, t \neq -3}.
$$

## Solution Sets

Because an expression may contain variables, an equation is true or false only if we substitute values into those variables. Until then, the equation is neither true nor false. If a value is substituted and the equation is true, we call that value the **solution**, or **root**, of the equation. The set of all roots to an equation is called the equation's **truth set** or **solution set**.

If the equation's solution set is the equation's domain, we call the equation an
**identity**.

**_example_**. ${x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3).}$

**_example_**. ${\dfrac{x^2}{x} = x.}$

## Number Sets

For the purposes of calculus, it suffices to give informal definitions of numbers.

<aside>
  Thorough definitions of the naturals and integers are typically presented in a
  set theory course; the rationals, irrationals, and reals in a real analysis
  course; and the complex numbers in a linear algebra course.
</aside>

> **Definition (informal): Real Numbers.** A real number is any number that can be expressed in decimal form. We denote the set of real numbers with the symbol ${\reals.}$

The real numbers can be represented as points on a _number line_. A fundamental fact: There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of real numbers and the set of points on a line. For each given point, the real number associated with that point is called the point's **coordinate**.

The naturals are the most basic numbers. These are the numbers we use for counting.

> **Definition (informal): Natural Numbers.** A natural number is any number of the set ${\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}.}$ We denote this set with the symbol ${\N.}$

The naturals with the negative numbers comprise the set of integers.

> **Definition (informal): Integers.** An integer is any number of the set ${\{ \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}.}$ We denote this set with the symbol ${\Z.}$

As its name suggests, a rational number is any number that can be written as the ratio of two integers.

> **Definition (informal): Rational Numbers.** Let ${a \in \Z}$ and let ${b \in \Z.}$ Then a rational number is any number of the form ${a/b.}$ We denote the set of all such numbers with the symbol ${\mathbb{Q}.}$

Any number that does not satisfy the definition of rational numbers is called an irrational number.

> **Definition (informal): Irrational Numbers.** Let ${x}$ be some number. If ${x \notin \mathbb{Q},}$ then ${x}$ is an irrational number.

Examples of irrational numbers include ${\sqrt{2},}$ ${\pi,}$ and Euler's number ${e.}$ None of these numbers can be written as a ratio of integers.

## Relations

In mathematics, a **relation** is the definition of some relationship between mathematical objects. We can relate one real to another in terms of their position on the real line. For example, viewing the real line, we can say that ${0}$ is "to the left" of ${1,}$ or, more succinctly, ${0 \lt 1.}$ We can talk about the reals in terms of their relations to other reals because of the fact that the real numbers are _ordered_: ${2}$ comes after ${1,}$ ${3}$ comes after ${2,}$ ${0}$ comes before ${1,}$ ${\pi}$ comes before ${4,}$ etc.

| Notation     | Definition                               | Example                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ${a \lt b}$  | ${a}$ is less than ${b.}$                | ${0 \lt 1.}$                |
| ${a \leq b}$ | ${a}$ is less than or equal to ${b.}$    | ${1 \leq 1,}$ ${0 \leq 1.}$ |
| ${a \gt b}$  | ${a}$ is greater than ${b.}$             | ${1 \gt 0.}$                |
| ${a \geq b}$ | ${a}$ is greater than or equal to ${b.}$ | ${1 \gt 1, 1 \gt 0.}$       |

## Intervals

When we work with ${\reals,}$ we often want to talk about sections of the real line (or, in terms of set theory, subsets of ${\reals}$). These sections, or subsets, can be defined in terms of intervals.

> **Definition.** The open interval ${(a,b)}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \lt x \lt b.}$ The closed interval ${[a,b]}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \leq x \leq b.}$ The left-inclusive interval ${[a,b)}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \leq x \lt b.}$ The right-inclusive interval ${(a,b]}$ consits of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \lt x \leq b.}$

In some cases, we may want talk about a subset of the reals that extends indefinitely in some direction. Such subsets are called **unbounded intervals**.

| Notation              | Inequality   |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| ${(a, \infty)}$       | ${x \gt a}$  |
| ${[a, \infty)}$       | ${x \geq a}$ |
| ${(-\infty, a)}$      | ${x \lt a}$  |
| ${(-\infty, a]}$      | ${x \leq a}$ |
| ${(-\infty, \infty)}$ |              |

## Absolute Value

For some problems, we want to think about how far a given real number ${x}$ is from ${0.}$ The operator for computing this distance is the _absolute value_.

> **Definition: Absolute Value.** Given ${x \in \reals,}$ the absolute value of ${x,}$ denoted ${| x |,}$ is defined as:
>
> $$
>     | x | = \begin{cases}
>     -x & \text{if} ~ x \lt 0 \\
>     x & \text{else}
>     \end{cases}.
> $$

**_example_**. ${|6 - 7| = |-1| = 1.}$

Given that real numbers can be interpreted as points on a number line, the distance between two real numbers is the absolute value of their difference.

> **Property.** Given ${a, b \in \R,}$ the distance between ${a}$ and ${b}$ is ${\vert a - b \vert = \vert b - a \vert.}$

Below are some additional properties of the absolute value.

| Property                                                                       | Comment                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ${\vert x \vert \geq 0}$                                                       | Absolute values are always nonnegative.                               |
| ${x \leq \vert x \vert}$                                                       |                                                                       |
| ${-x \leq \vert x \vert}$                                                      |                                                                       |
| ${\vert x \vert^2 = x^2}$                                                      |                                                                       |
| ${\sqrt{x^2} = \vert x \vert}$                                                 |                                                                       |
| ${\vert ab \vert = \vert a \vert \vert b \vert}$                               |                                                                       |
| ${\left\vert \dfrac{a}{b} \right\vert = \dfrac{\vert a \vert}{\vert b \vert}}$ | ${b \neq 0}$                                                          |
| ${\vert a + b \vert \leq \vert a \vert + \vert b \vert}$                       | This is a rather famous property, called the **triangle inequality**. |

## Equations

We now examine equations. Recall that an equation is a special type of mathematical statement. Specifically, one that claims: "The expression on the left of the "${=}$" is the same, in every way, as the expression on the right of the "${=.}$"

**_example_**. ${a = b}$ means "${a}$ is the same, in every way, as ${b.}$"

When equations contain variables, they belong to a type of mathematical statement called an **open sentence** &mdash; a statement that contains one or more variables, and becomes a proposition when each variable is substituted with an element from the expression's domain. For example, the equation ${a = b}$ is true when ${a = 1}$ and ${b = 1,}$ but false when ${a = 0}$ and ${b = 1.}$

When a value is substituted for a variable in an equation such that the equation is true, we say that the value **satisfies** the equation, and that the value is a **solution** to the equation. When two equations have the exact same set of solutions, we say that the two equations are **equivalent**. A common procedure in algebra is solving for a given variable. This is done by writing a sequence of equivalent equations until we get to the form ${\text{variable} = \text{constant}}$ (e.g., ${x = 1}$ or ${z = \pi}$).

The following principles apply to generating equivalent equations:

1. Adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of an equation produces an equivalent equation.
2. Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by the same nonzero quantity produces an equivalent equation.
3. Simplifying an expression on either side of an equation produces an equivalent equation.

Equations &mdash; and more generally, expressions &mdash; are simply succinct ways of expressing sentences that would otherwise be too cumbersome to write by prose. For example, consider the following sentence:

- The integral with respect to ${z}$ from zero to three point eight of the quotient of the product of the fourth power of Pi, ${x,}$ and ${y}$ multiplied by the sum of ${a,}$ the product of eight, ${b,}$ and the cosine of the quotient of the product of Pi and ${z}$ divided by ${l,}$ the product of eighteen, ${c,}$ and the cosine of the quotient of two, Pi, and ${z,}$ and the square of the sine of the quotient of Pi and ${z}$ divided by ${l,}$ all divided by the the fourth power of ${l.}$

This mouthful can be _expressed_ as:

$$
	\int_0^{3.8}\frac{\pi^4 x y (a+9 c+8 b \cos(\frac{\pi z}{l})+18 c \cos(\frac{2 \pi z}{l})) \sin^2(\frac{\pi z}{l})}{l^4} dz.
$$

## Families of Expressions

When we examine the variety of expressions found in mathematics, we find that certain groups of expressions share similiar patterns and properties. To try and organize this vast variety, we will organize these expressions into _families of expressions_, or _kinds of expressions_.

### Linear Expressions

The simplest family of expressions is the **linear expression in one variable**. As simple as such expressions are, many real world problems can be reduced to linear expressions, or more specifically, linear equations.

<aside>

Complex problems can be reduced to _systems of linear equations_. Analyzing these systems is a key topic in the study of [linear algebra](/pages/linear-algebra).

</aside>

> **Definition.** A linear expression in one variable is an expression that can be written in the form
>
> $$
>    ax + b,
> $$
>
> where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$

In the definition above, we call the expressions ${ax}$ and ${b}$ the **terms** &mdash; or, more generally, the **subexpressions** &mdash; of the linear expression.

### Monomial Expressions

The terms of a linear expression are themselves a special type of expression called **monomial expressions**. The simplest monomial expression is the **univariate monomial expression**, or the **monomial expression in one variable**.

> **Definition.** Let ${u}$ be an expression. We say that ${u}$ is a _univariate monomial expression_ in a single variable ${x}$ if ${u}$ satisfies one of the following rules:
>
> 1. ${u}$ is an integer or fraction.
> 2. ${u = x.}$
> 3. ${u = x^n,}$ where ${n \in \Z}$ and ${n \gt 1.}$
> 4. ${u}$ is a product with two operands that satisfies either (1), (2), or (3).

Below is a procedure for determining whether a given expression is a univariate monomial in a variable ${x}$:

<Procedure>

- **Procedure** isMonomial(${u}$, ${x}$)
- **Input**
  - ${u}$: An algebraic expression.
  - ${x}$: A symbol.
- **Output**
  - true or false

1. if ${u \in (\Z \cup \mathbb{Q})}$ then
   1. return true
2. else if ${u = x}$ then
   1. return true
3. else if ${u}$ is a power
   1. ${base}$ ${\coloneqq}$ operand(${u}$, 1)
   2. ${exponent}$ ${\coloneqq}$ operand(${u}$, 2)
   3. if ${(base = x) \land (base \in \Z) \land (exponent \gt 1)}$ then
      1. return true
4. else if ${u}$ is a product
   1. ${opcount \coloneqq operandCount(u,2)}$
   2. ${r_1 \coloneqq isMonomial(operand(u,1),x)}$
   3. ${r_2 \coloneqq isMonomial(operand(u,2), x)}$
   4. return ${opcount \land r_1 \land r_2}$
5. return false

</Procedure>

### Quadratic Expressions

> **Definition.** A quadratic expression in one variable is an expression that can be written in the form
>
> $$
>    ax^2 + bx + c,
> $$
>
> with ${a,b,c \in \reals}$ and ${a \neq 0.}$

The following property is often useful to solving quadratic equations:

> **Property.** ${pq = 0}$ if and only if ${p = 0}$ or ${q = 0.}$

#### The Quadratic Formula

We can also solve quadratic equations directly with the quadratic formula:

> **Formula.** The solutions of the quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0,}$ are given by
>
> $$
>    x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
> $$

### Polynomial Expressions

Quadratic expressions can be generalized as polynomial expressions in one variable. I.e., they are a specific type of polynomial expression in one variable.

> **Definition.** A polynomial ${u}$ in one variable is an expression of the form:
>
> $$
>    u_nx^n + u_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + u_1x + u_0,
> $$
>
> where the coefficients ${u_j}$ are rational numbers, and ${n}$ is a non-negative integer.

If ${u_n \neq 0,}$ we call ${u_n}$ the **leading coefficient** of ${u}$ and ${n}$ the **degree** of ${u.}$ The expression ${u = 0}$ is called the **zero polynomial**. By convention, the zero polynomial has leading coefficient ${0}$ and, according to mathematical convention, has degree ${-\infty.}$

To aid our discussion on polynomials, we define the following operators.

> **Definition.** Let ${u}$ be a polynomial expression in a single variable ${x.}$ Then:
>
> $$
>    \text{deg}(u,x)
> $$
>
> corresponds to the degree of ${u}$ and
>
> $$
>    \text{lc}(u,x)
> $$
>
> corresponds to the leading coefficient of ${u.}$ If the variable ${x}$ is clear from context, we use the shorthand notation ${\text{deg}(u)}$ and ${\text{lc}(u).}$

#### Multivariate Polynomials

A _multivariate polynomial_ is a polynomial that contains one or more variables.

> **Definition.** A _multivariate polynomial_ ${u}$ in the set of symbols ${\lbrace x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m \rbrace}$ is a finite sum with one or more monomial terms of the form
>
> $$
>  c x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \ldots x_m^{n_m},
> $$
>
> where the coefficient ${c}$ is a rational number and the exponents ${n_j}$ are non-negative integers.

**_example_**. ${x^2 - y^2}$

**_example_**. ${mc^2}$

**_example_**. ${a + \dfrac{1}{2}ax^2 + aby.}$

**_example_**. ${ax^2 + bx + 3c.}$

**_example_**. ${3x^2 + 4.}$

From the last example, we see that all univariate polynomials are multivariate polynomials, since a multivariate polynomial is a polynomial that contains _one or more_ variables.

#### General Monomial Expressions

> **Definition.** Let ${c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_r}$ be algebraic expressions and let ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m}$ be algebraic expressions that are not integers or fractions. A _general monomial expression_ (GME) in ${\lbrace x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m \rbrace}$ is an expression of the form
>
> $$
>  c_1 c_2 \ldots c_r x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \ldots x_m^{n_m},
> $$
>
> where the exponents ${n_j}$ are non-negative integers and each ${c_i}$ does not contain an expression ${x_j}$ for ${j = 1,2,\ldots,m.}$

In the definition above, the expressions ${x_j}$ are called _generalized variables_, and the expressions ${c_i}$ are called _generalized coefficients_. The expression ${x_1^{n_1} \ldots x_m^{n_m}}$ is called the _variable part_ of the monomial. If there aren't any generalized coefficients in the monomial, the coefficient is ${1.}$

#### General Polynomial Expression

> **Definition.** A general polynomial expression (GPE) is a GME or a sum of GMEs.

## Cartesian Plane

The _Cartesian plane_ is a plane constructed from two perpendicular real lines, called _axes_. The horizontal line is called the ${x}$-axis, and the vertical line is called the ${y}$-axis. If we place a point ${p}$ on this plane, then that point can be represented as a pair ${(x_p,y_p),}$ where ${x_p}$ is the point's coordinate on the ${x}$-axis and ${y_p}$ is the point's coordinate on the ${y}$-axis.

import { Calc1 } from "@/components/Fig";

<Calc1 />

The point of intersection of the two axes is called the _origin_, usually denoted by the letter ${O.}$ The plane is divided into four regions called _quadrants_, often labeled ${\text{I}}$ through ${\text{IV}.}$

The pair ${(x_p, y_p)}$ is an example of an _ordered pair_. We call the coordinate ${x_p}$ the ordered pair's _abscissa_ and ${y_p}$ the _ordinate_. For brevity, the notation ${p(x, y)}$ means that the point ${p}$ has the coordinates ${(x,y).}$

### The Distance Between Two Points

Suppose we're given two points ${P(x_P, y_P)}$ and ${Q(x_Q, y_Q).}$ We want to know the distance between these two points. For example, in the diagram below, what is the length of the red line between the red dots?

import { DistanceBetweenPoints } from "@/components/Fig";

<DistanceBetweenPoints />

We can solve this problem by employing one of the oldest theorems in mathematics:

> **Pythagorean Theorem.** In a right triangle, the lengths of the sides are related by the equation
>
> $$
>    a^2 + b^2 = c^2,
> $$
>
> where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are the lengths of the sides forming the right triangle and ${c}$ is the length of the hyptonuse (the side opposite the right angle).

So, if we suppose that the red line in our diagram is ${c,}$ then the length of that line is found by solving for ${c:}$

$$
    c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$

But what are ${a}$ and ${b}$? They must be the lengths of the other sides of the right triangle:

import { DistanceBetweenPoints2 } from "@/components/Fig";

<DistanceBetweenPoints2 />

Thus, we have the following formula.

> **Distance Formula**. The distance ${d}$ between points ${(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${(x_2, y_2)}$ is given by
>
> $$
>    d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.
> $$

### Midpoint Formula

Given two points ${P(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${Q(x_2, y_2),}$ what is the midpoint of the line segment joining ${P}$ and ${Q}$? For example, consider the figure below. The midpoint is marked by the red point. What is the coordinate of this point?

import { MidpointFig } from "@/components/Fig";

<MidpointFig />

Here, we apply the midpoint formula:

> **Midpoint Formula**. Given points ${P(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${Q(x_2, y_2),}$ the midpoint of the line segment joining ${P}$ and ${Q}$ has the coordinates:
>
> $$
>    \left( \dfrac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right).
> $$

## Real Functions

We now turn our attention towards the _real functions_ &mdash; functions with the signature ${A \to B,}$ where ${A \subseteq \reals}$ and ${B \subseteq \reals.}$

### Affine Functions

In the sea of real functions, affine functions are among the most desirable. They're easy to understand because they're easy to gut &mdash; internally, they have at most two operations: multiplication and addition.

> **Definition.** Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are real number constants. A function of the form
>
> $$
>    f(x) = ax + b
> $$
>
> is called an _affine function_. In the case where ${a = 0,}$ then ${f(x) = b,}$ and we call ${f}$ a _constant function_. In the case where ${b = 0}$ and ${a \neq 0,}$ then ${f(x) = ax,}$ and we call ${f}$ a _linear function_.

The graph of an affine function ${f}$ is a continuous straight line. If ${a \gt 0,}$ then ${f}$ is strictly increasing. If ${a \lt 0,}$ then ${f}$ is strictly decreasing. If ${a \neq 0,}$ then then ${f}$ has a unique zero ${x = -\dfrac{b}{a}.}$ To demonstrate these facts, consider the interactive figure below. Adjust the ${a}$ and ${b}$ values to see what happens to our line.

import { AffineFunctionLab } from "@/components/Fig";

<AffineFunctionLab />

If ${f}$ is an affine function, then ${f}$ has a constant rate of change equal to the slope of its graph. Conversely, if a function ${f}$ has a constant rate of change, then ${f}$ must be an affine function.

### Quadratic Functions

> **Definition.** Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ be real number constants, with ${a \neq 0.}$ A function of the form
>
> $$
>    f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
> $$
>
> is called a _quadratic function_ with leading coefficient ${a.}$

<aside>
  The word _quadratic_ is derived from the Latin _quadratus_, meaning "square."

The graph of a quadratic function is called a _parabola_. Given the quadratic function ${f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c,}$ if ${a \gt 0,}$ then the parabola has a _local minimum_ at ${x = -\dfrac{b}{2a}}$ and the parabola is _convex_. If ${a \lt 0,}$ then the parabola has a _local maximum_ at ${x = - \dfrac{b}{2a}}$ and the parabola is _concave_.

Below is an interactive plot of a quadratic.

All parabolas have a special point called the _vertex_. This point is given by:

$$
    \left( -\dfrac{b}{2a}, \dfrac{4ac - b^2}{4a} \right).
$$

A few observations playing with this plot: First, the graph of ${y = ax^2}$ is a parabola with its vertex at the origin. It is similar in shape to ${y = x^2.}$ Second, the parabola ${y = ax^2}$ opens upward if ${a \gt 0,}$ and downward if ${a \lt 0.}$ And third, the parabola ${y = ax^2}$ is narrower than ${y = x^2}$ if ${\lvert a \rvert \gt 1,}$ and wider than ${y = x^2}$ if ${\lvert a \rvert \lt 1.}$

Importantly, through completing the square, the equation of the parabola ${y = ax^2 + bx + c}$ can always be written in the form

$$
  y = (x - h)^2 + k,
$$

where ${(h,k)}$ is the parabola's vertex and the axis of symmetry is the line ${x = h.}$ The parabola opens upward if ${a \lt 0}$ and downward if ${a \lt 0.}$

#### The Discriminant

The quantity ${b^2 - 4ac}$ is called the _discriminant_ of ${ax^2 + bx + c.}$ The equation

$$
    y = a\left(x + \dfrac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \dfrac{4ac - b^2}{4a}
$$

is called the _canonical equation_ of the parabola ${y = ax^2 + bx + c.}$ Notice that the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line ${x = -\dfrac{b}{2a},}$ passing through the vertex. This line, called the _axis of symmetry_, is parallel to the ${y}$-axis. Suppose ${(h,k)}$ is the parabola's vertex. Using the method of completing the square, the parabola's equation (with its axis of symmetry parallel to the ${y}$-axis) can be written in the form ${y = a(x - h)^2 + k.}$

#### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula provides a quick and easy way to find the roots of a polynomial equation.

> **Formula.** Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ be constants in ${\reals.}$ The roots of the equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$ are given by the formula
>
> $$
>    x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
> $$

When can gain many insights about a particular quadratic by simply examining its determinant.

> **Corollary.** Suppose ${u}$ is the quadratic ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$ with ${a \neq 0,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ as real constants. Then the following are true:
>
> 1. If ${b^2 - 4ac = 0,}$ then ${u}$ is tangent to the ${x}$-axis and has one (repeated) real root.
> 2. If ${b^2 - 4ac \gt 0,}$ then the parabola has two distinct real roots.
> 3. If ${b^2 - 4ac \lt 0,}$ then the parabola has two complex roots.
> 4. If ${b^2 - 4ac \gt 0,}$ then ${u}$ has the same sign as ${A.}$

#### The Square Function

> **_definition_**. The square function is a function of the form
>
> $$
>  f(x) = x^2.
> $$

Suppose ${f}$ is the square function ${f(x) = x^2.}$ Then: ${f}$ is an even function; its graph is symmetric about the ${y}$-axis. ${f}$ is an increasing function for ${x \gt 0,}$ and a decreasing function for ${x \lt 0.}$ ${f}$ has a minimum value at ${x = 0.}$ ${f(x)}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive or negative.

#### Even Power Functions

The graphs of ${y = x^{2n + 2},}$ where ${n \in \natnums}$ (e.g., ${y = x^2,}$ ${y = x^4,}$ ${y = x^6,}$ etc.) look similar to one another. For ${-1 \leq x \leq 1,}$ the higher the exponent, the flatter the graph is along the ${x}$-axis. This follows from the fact that, where ${-1 \leq x \leq 1,}$ ${\lvert x \rvert \implies \ldots \lt x^6 \lt x^4 \lt x^2 \lt 1.}$

### Cubic Functions

> **Definition.** Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ ${c,}$ and ${d}$ be real number constants with ${a \neq 0.}$ A function of the form
>
> $$
>  f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
> $$
>
> is called a _cubic function_.

The graph of a cubic function is a _cubic curve_. As seen from its general form, the cubic curve depends on four parameters: ${a,}$ ${b,}$ ${c,}$ and ${d.}$ Where ${a = 1,}$ ${b = 0,}$ ${c = 0,}$ ${d = 0,}$ we get the simplest cubic:

$$
  f(x) = x^3.
$$

The graph of the cubic function ${f(x) = x^3}$ is concave when ${x \lt 0}$ and convex when ${x \gt 0.}$ Examining the behavior of ${f(x) = x^3,}$ we see that ${f}$ is an increasing odd function.

#### The Cube Function

> **_definition_**. The cube function ${f}$ is defined as
>
> $$
>  f(x) = x^3.
> $$

Some properties of the cube function ${f:}$ ${f}$ is an odd function; its graph is symmetric about the origin. ${f}$ is an increasing function for all real numbers. ${f}$ has no maximum or minimum. ${f(x)}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive. ${f(x)}$ becomes unbounded negative as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative.

#### Odd Power Functions

The graphs of ${y = x^{2n + 3},}$ ${n \in \natnums}$ (e.g., ${y = x^3,}$ ${y = x^5,}$ ${y = x^7,}$ etc.) look similar to one another. For ${-1 \leq x \leq 1,}$ the higher the exponent, the flatter the graph is to the ${x}$-axis, since

$$
  \lvert x \rvert \lt 1 \implies \ldots \lt \lvert x^7 \rvert \lt \lvert x^5 \rvert \lt \lvert x^3 \rvert \lt 1.
$$

For ${\lvert x \rvert \geq 1,}$ the higher the exponent, the steeper the graph will be. This follows from the fact that

$$
  \lvert x \rvert \gt 1 \implies \ldots \gt \lvert x^7 \rvert \gt \lvert x^5 \rvert \gt \lvert x^3 \rvert \gt 1.
$$

### Polynomial Functions

> **_definition_**. A polynomial function ${f}$ is a function of the form
>
> $$
>  f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0,
> $$
>
> where ${n \in \natnums}$ and each ${a_i}$ is a constant. If ${a_n \neq 0,}$ the _degree_ of the polynomial function is ${n.}$

Functions of the form ${y = x^n}$ with ${n \in \natnums}$ (e.g., the square and cubic functions) are called _power functions_. They are the simplest polynomial functions, and can be interpreted as the building blocks of more complex polynomial functions.

#### Graphs of Polynomial Functions

Suppose ${f}$ is a polynomial function. If ${\deg(u) = 0}$ or ${\deg(u) = 1,}$ then the graph of ${f}$ is a line. If ${\deg(u) \geq 2,}$ then the graph of ${f}$ is an unbroken smooth curve. The graph of a polynomial function of degree ${n}$ has at most ${n - 1}$ turning points. Regardless of the degree, as ${\lvert x \rvert}$ gets very large, ${\lvert y \rvert}$ grows very large (except, of course, for the constant function). The following theorem, stated informally, is often helpful for getting a rough idea of a given polynomial's behavior.

> **_theorem_**. Suppose ${f}$ is a polynomial function of the form
>
> $$
>  f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0
> $$
>
> with ${a_n \neq 0.}$ Then
>
> $$
>  f(x) \approx a_n x^n
> $$
>
> when ${\lvert x \rvert}$ is very large.

### Rational Functions

> **_definition_**. A rational function ${r}$ is a function of the form
>
> $$
>  r(x) = \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)},
> $$
>
> where ${f}$ and ${g}$ are [polynomial functions](#polynomial-functions).

The graphs of rational functions differ from that of polynomial functions significantly because they employ the operation of _division_. That operation, as we all know, has a strict restriction: We cannot divide by ${0.}$ To illustrate, consider the graph of ${f(x) = 1/x}$ (drag the slider to change the ${x}$ value of the point on the graph).

import { Rat1 } from "@/components/Fig";

<Rat1 />

Notice that the graph comprises two separate curves, rather than the single continuous curve we see with polynomials. We call these curves the _branches_ or _arms_ of the rational function's graphs. The function ${f(x) = 1/x}$ has the following properties:

1. ${f}$ is an odd function; its graph is symmetric about the origin.
2. ${f}$ is decreasing for ${x \lt 0}$ and for ${x \gt 0.}$
3. ${f}$ has no maximum or minimum.
4. ${f(x)}$ approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive and from below as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative.
5. ${f(x)}$ becomes unbounded negative as ${x}$ approaches zero from the left and unbounded positive as ${x}$ approaches zero from the right.

Now consider the function ${g(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}.}$ This function has the following plot:

import { Rat2 } from "@/components/Fig";

<Rat2 />

Some properties of the graph of ${g(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}:}$

1. ${g}$ is an even function; its graph is symmetric about the ${y}$-axis.
2. ${g}$ is increasing on ${(-\infty, 0)}$ and decreasing on ${(0, \infty).}$
3. ${g}$ has no maximum or minimum.
4. ${g(x)}$ approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive or negative.
5. ${g(x)}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ approaches zero from the left or right.

#### Graphs of 1/ùë•‚Åø

In general, the graph of ${f(x) = 1/x^n}$ where ${n \in \Z^+}$ will resemble either ${1/x^2}$ or ${1/x.}$ If ${n}$ is an even integer, then ${f}$'s graph will resember ${1/x^2.}$ If ${n}$ is an odd integer, then ${f}$'s graph will resember ${1/x.}$

### Exponential Functions

> **_definition_**. Let ${b}$ denote an arbitrary constant, with ${b \gt 0}$ and ${b \neq 1.}$ The exponential function ${f}$ with base ${b}$ is a function of the form
>
> $$
>  f(x) = ab^{kx},
> $$
>
> where ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${k}$ are real constants.

**_example_**. ${f(x) = 2^x.}$ Below is ${f}$'s graph.

import { Exp1 } from "@/components/Fig";

<Exp1 />

Some observations of ${f(x) = 2^x}$ and its graph:

1. The domain of ${f}$ is ${\reals.}$ The range is ${\reals^+.}$
2. The ${y}$-intercept is ${1.}$ The graph never crosses the ${x}$-axis, so ${f}$ has no ${x}$-intercept.
3. For ${x \gt 0,}$ ${f}$ increases rapidly.
4. For ${x \lt 0,}$ ${f}$ rapidly approaches the ${x}$-axis. The ${x}$-axis is a horizontal asymptote for the graph; ${f}$ approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative.
5. ${f}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive.
6. The function is one-to-one.

More generally, for the function ${f(x) = b^x}$ with ${b \gt 0}$ and ${b \neq 1,}$

1. For ${b \gt 1,}$ ${f}$ approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative, and becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive.
2. For ${0 \lt b \lt 1,}$ ${b^x}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative and approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive.

#### The Exponential Function ${y = e^x}$

Euler's number ${e}$ is an irrational number:

$$
  e = 2.7182818284\ldots
$$

This number is particularly special because it makes handling exponentials much simpler. The graph of ${f(x) = e^x:}$

### Logarithmic Functions

To study the logarithmic functions, we must first study logarithms as expressions and operators.

#### Logarithms

> **_definition_**. The expression
>
> $$
>  \log_b x
> $$
>
> means, "the exponent to which ${b}$ must be raised to yield ${x.}$" We read the expression, "log base ${b}$ of ${x}$" or "the logarithm of ${x}$ to the base ${b.}$"

The logarithm is a binary operator. It takes two arguments: First, a base ${b,}$ and second, some real number ${x:}$

$$
  \log(b,x) \mapsto y
$$

When we evaluate this expression, we get a real number ${y}$ that satisfies the following relation:

$$
  b^y = x.
$$

In other words, the logarithm answers the question, "What is the number I must raise ${b}$ to, such that I get ${x?}$" Following convention, instead of writing ${\log(b,x),}$ we will instead write:

$$
  \log_b x.
$$

Using this notation, we state the following equivalence:

$$
  y = \log_b x \iff x = b^y.
$$

The equation ${y = \log_b x}$ is in _logarithmic form_, and the equation ${x = b^y}$ is in _exponential form_. Some logarithms of a particular base are given special symbols as operators:

| Symbol  | Meaning                                                                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ${\ln}$ | ${\log_e}$ (log of base ${e}$, called the _natural logarithm_ or _natural log_). |
| ${\lg}$ | ${\log_2}$ (log of base ${2}$, called the _binary logarithm_ or _binary log_).   |

In this text, we will use the following conventions: ${\log}$ is assumed to be ${\log_{10},}$ ${\ln}$ is the natural log, ${\lg}$ is the binary log, and all other logarithms will have a specified base.

#### Manipulating Logarithms
The following properties are essential to working with logarithms efficiently and cleanly.

<Cols of={2}>

<div>

- ${\log_n b = 1.}$
- ${\log_n 1 = 0.}$
- ${\log_n ab = \log_n a + \log_n b.}$
- ${\log_n \frac{a}{b} = \log_n a - \log_n b.}$

</div>
<div>

- ${\log_n \frac{1}{x} = - \log_n x.}$
- ${\log_n x^r = r \log_n x}$ for all ${x \in \reals.}$
- ${n^{\log_n x} = x.}$
- ${\log_n n^x = x}$ for all ${x \in \reals.}$

</div>

</Cols>

The following equation is another useful fact to keep in mind. As its name implies, this equation allows us to rewrite logarithms as logarithms of different bases.

> __*change of base.*__ ${\log_a x = \dfrac{\log_b x}{\log_b a}.}$


#### Logarithmic Behavior
Below are graphs of various logarithmic functions:

import {LogFig1} from "@/components/Fig";

<LogFig1/>

Notice that ${f(x)}$ grows or increases _very_ slowly. It is always increasing as ${x}$ increases, just very, very slowly. Given a function of the form ${f(x) = \log_b x,}$ with ${b \gt 1,}$ we have the following properties:

1. ${\text{dom}(f) = \reals^+}$ (all positive real numbers).
2. ${\text{ran}(f) = \reals.}$
3. There is no ${y}$-intercept.
4. The ${x}$-intercept is ${1.}$
5. The assymptote is ${x = 0}$ (i.e., ${y}$-axis).
6. End behavior: ${f}$ becomes unbounded negative as ${x}$ approaches ${0}$ from the right and becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive.
