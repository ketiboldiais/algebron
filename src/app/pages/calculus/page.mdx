## Expressions
- In algebra, we use letters like ${x,}$ ${y,}$ ${n,}$ and ${m}$ to represent some object (e.g., numbers). These letters are called _variables_. When we combine these variables with mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.), we obtain an _expression_.
  - __*example.*__ The following are all expressions:
      $$
          a + 2 \\[1em]
          x^2 \\[1em]
          \dfrac{x^{1/3} + y}{xy}
      $$
  - __*example.*__ Of course, expressions need not have variables. These are expressions, too:

    $$
        1 + 1 \\[1em]
        2/3 \\[1em]
        \pi
    $$
- When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we have an _equation_. This is just a symbolic way of saying, "These two expressions are the same."
  - __*example.*__ Here is a famous equation:
    $$
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
    $$

## The Domain of an Expression

- All mathematical expressions have a _domain_ ‚Äì the set of all values for which the expression is defined.
  - __*example.*__ In the expression ${a^2 + b^2 = c^2,}$ we assume the expression is defined for real numbers. That is, the expression only makes sense if we plug real numbers into the variables. It would not make sense if the domain included, say, dogs. Of course, it very well could, but we'd have to define what it means to square and add dogs:

    $$
        \text{rottweiler}^2 + \text{greyhound}^2 = \text{mastiff}^2.
    $$

    The point is, outside the expression's domain, the expression is undefined.

- __*definition.*__ Given an expression ${u,}$ the notation

  $$
      \text{dom}(u)
  $$

  denotes the domain of ${u.}$

  - **_example_**. In the expression ${1/((t-1)(t-3)),}$ we define the domain to be all real numbers (${\reals}$), not including ${1}$ and not including ${-3.}$ If we let ${t = 1}$ or ${t = -3,}$ then we have a zero denominator. And as we all know, we cannot divide by zero.

    $$
        \text{dom} \left( \dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)} \right) = \set{t \in \reals | t \neq 1, t \neq -3}.
    $$

## Solution Sets
- Because an expression may contain variables, an equation is true or false only if we substitute values into those variables. Until then, the equation is neither true nor false.
- If a value is substituted and the equation is true, we call that value the _solution_, or _root_, of the equation.
- The set of all roots to an equation is called the equation's _truth set_ or _solution set_.
- If the equation's solution set is the equation's domain, we call the equation an
_identity_.
  - **_example_**. ${x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3).}$
  - **_example_**. ${\dfrac{x^2}{x} = x.}$

## Numbers
- We will start by giving informal definitions of numbers.
- __*informal definition*__. A real number is any number that can be expressed in decimal form. We denote the set of real numbers with the symbol ${\reals.}$
  - The real numbers can be represented as points on a _number line_.
  - A fundamental fact: There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of real numbers and the set of points on a line. For each given point, the real number associated with that point is called the point's **coordinate**.
- __*informal definition*__. A natural number is any number of the set ${\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}.}$ We denote this set with the symbol ${\N.}$
  - The naturals are the most basic numbers. These are the numbers we use for counting.
- __*informal definition*__. An integer is any number of the set ${\{ \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}.}$ We denote this set with the symbol ${\Z.}$
  - The naturals with the negative numbers comprise the set of integers.
  - As its name suggests, a rational number is any number that can be written as the ratio of two integers.
- __*informal definition*__. Let ${a \in \Z}$ and let ${b \in \Z.}$ Then a rational number is any number of the form ${a/b.}$ We denote the set of all such numbers with the symbol ${\mathbb{Q}.}$
- __*informal definition*__. Let ${x}$ be some number. If ${x \notin \mathbb{Q},}$ then ${x}$ is an irrational number.
  - Any number that does not satisfy the definition of rational numbers is called an irrational number.
  - Examples of irrational numbers include ${\sqrt{2},}$ ${\pi,}$ and Euler's number ${e.}$ None of these numbers can be written as a ratio of integers.

## Relations
- In mathematics, a **relation** is the definition of some relationship between mathematical objects.
- We can relate one real to another in terms of their position on the real line. 
  - __*example*__. Viewing the real line, we can say that ${0}$ is "to the left" of ${1,}$ or, more succinctly, ${0 \lt 1.}$ We can talk about the reals in terms of their relations to other reals because of the fact that the real numbers are _ordered_: ${2}$ comes after ${1,}$ ${3}$ comes after ${2,}$ ${0}$ comes before ${1,}$ ${\pi}$ comes before ${4,}$ etc.
- Below is a table of common notations for relations.
  | Notation     | Definition                               | Example                     |
  | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
  | ${a \lt b}$  | ${a}$ is less than ${b.}$                | ${0 \lt 1.}$                |
  | ${a \leq b}$ | ${a}$ is less than or equal to ${b.}$    | ${1 \leq 1,}$ ${0 \leq 1.}$ |
  | ${a \gt b}$  | ${a}$ is greater than ${b.}$             | ${1 \gt 0.}$                |
  | ${a \geq b}$ | ${a}$ is greater than or equal to ${b.}$ | ${1 \gt 1, 1 \gt 0.}$       |

## Intervals
- When we work with ${\reals,}$ we often want to talk about sections of the real line (or, in terms of set theory, subsets of ${\reals}$). These sections, or subsets, can be defined in terms of intervals.
- __*definition*__. The open interval ${(a,b)}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \lt x \lt b.}$ The closed interval ${[a,b]}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \leq x \leq b.}$ The left-inclusive interval ${[a,b)}$ consists of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \leq x \lt b.}$ The right-inclusive interval ${(a,b]}$ consits of all reals ${x}$ such that ${a \lt x \leq b.}$
- In some cases, we may want talk about a subset of the reals that extends indefinitely in some direction. Such subsets are called **unbounded intervals**.
- Below are common notations for intervals.
  | Notation              | Inequality   |
  | --------------------- | ------------ |
  | ${(a, \infty)}$       | ${x \gt a}$  |
  | ${[a, \infty)}$       | ${x \geq a}$ |
  | ${(-\infty, a)}$      | ${x \lt a}$  |
  | ${(-\infty, a]}$      | ${x \leq a}$ |
  | ${(-\infty, \infty)}$ |              |

## Absolute Value
- For some problems, we want to think about how far a given real number ${x}$ is from ${0.}$ The operator for computing this distance is the _absolute value_.
- __*definition*__. Given ${x \in \reals,}$ the absolute value of ${x,}$ denoted ${| x |,}$ is defined as:
  $$
      | x | = \begin{cases}
      -x & \text{if} ~ x \lt 0 \\
      x & \text{else}
      \end{cases}.
  $$
  - **_example_**. ${|6 - 7| = |-1| = 1.}$
- Given that real numbers can be interpreted as points on a number line, the distance between two real numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
- __*property*__. Given ${a, b \in \R,}$ the distance between ${a}$ and ${b}$ is ${\vert a - b \vert = \vert b - a \vert.}$
- Below are some additional properties of the absolute value.
  | Property                                                                       | Comment                                                               |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | ${\vert x \vert \geq 0}$                                                       | Absolute values are always nonnegative.                               |
  | ${x \leq \vert x \vert}$                                                       |                                                                       |
  | ${-x \leq \vert x \vert}$                                                      |                                                                       |
  | ${\vert x \vert^2 = x^2}$                                                      |                                                                       |
  | ${\sqrt{x^2} = \vert x \vert}$                                                 |                                                                       |
  | ${\vert ab \vert = \vert a \vert \vert b \vert}$                               |                                                                       |
  | ${\left\vert \dfrac{a}{b} \right\vert = \dfrac{\vert a \vert}{\vert b \vert}}$ | ${b \neq 0}$                                                          |
  | ${\vert a + b \vert \leq \vert a \vert + \vert b \vert}$                       | This is a rather famous property, called the **triangle inequality**. |

## Equations
- An equation is a mathematical statement that claims: "The expression on the left of the "${=}$" is the same, in every way, as the expression on the right of the "${=.}$"
- **_example_**. ${a = b}$ means "${a}$ is the same, in every way, as ${b.}$"
- When equations contain variables, they belong to a type of mathematical statement called an _open sentence_ &mdash; a statement that contains one or more variables, and becomes a proposition when each variable is substituted with an element from the expression's domain.
- __*example*__. The equation ${a = b}$ is true when ${a = 1}$ and ${b = 1,}$ but false when ${a = 0}$ and ${b = 1.}$
- When a value is substituted for a variable in an equation such that the equation is true, we say that the value _satisfies_ the equation, and that the value is a _solution_ to the equation.
- When two equations have the exact same set of solutions, we say that the two equations are _equivalent_.
- A common procedure in algebra is solving for a given variable. This is done by writing a sequence of equivalent equations until we get to the form ${\text{variable} = \text{constant}}$ (e.g., ${x = 1}$ or ${z = \pi}$).
- The following principles apply to generating equivalent equations:
  1. Adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of an equation produces an equivalent equation.
  2. Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by the same nonzero quantity produces an equivalent equation.
  3. Simplifying an expression on either side of an equation produces an equivalent equation.
- Equations &mdash; and more generally, expressions &mdash; are simply succinct ways of expressing sentences that would otherwise be too cumbersome to write by prose.

## Families of Expressions
- When we examine the variety of expressions found in mathematics, we find that certain groups of expressions share similiar patterns and properties. To try and organize this vast variety, we will organize these expressions into _families of expressions_, or _kinds of expressions_.

### Linear Expressions
- The simplest family of expressions is the _linear expression in one variable_. As simple as such expressions are, many real world problems can be reduced to linear expressions, or more specifically, linear equations.

<aside>

Complex problems can be reduced to _systems of linear equations_. Analyzing these systems is a key topic in the study of [linear algebra](/pages/linear-algebra).

</aside>

- __*definition*__. A linear expression in one variable is an expression that can be written in the form

  $$
      ax + b,
  $$

  where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$
- In the definition above, we call the expressions ${ax}$ and ${b}$ the _terms_ &mdash; or, more generally, the _subexpressions_ &mdash; of the linear expression.

### Monomial Expressions
- The terms of a linear expression are themselves a special type of expression called _monomial expressions_.
- The simplest monomial expression is the _univariate monomial expression_, or the _monomial expression in one variable_.
- __*definition*__. Let ${u}$ be an expression. We say that ${u}$ is a _univariate monomial expression_ in a single variable ${x}$ if ${u}$ satisfies one of the following rules:
  1. ${u}$ is an integer or fraction.
  2. ${u = x.}$
  3. ${u = x^n,}$ where ${n \in \Z}$ and ${n \gt 1.}$
  4. ${u}$ is a product with two operands that satisfies either (1), (2), or (3).

### Quadratic Expressions
- __*definition*__. A quadratic expression in one variable is an expression that can be written in the form
  $$
      ax^2 + bx + c,
  $$
  with ${a,b,c \in \reals}$ and ${a \neq 0.}$
- __*property*__. ${pq = 0}$ if and only if ${p = 0}$ or ${q = 0.}$

#### The Quadratic Formula
- We can also solve quadratic equations directly with the quadratic formula:
- __*formula*__. The solutions of the quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0,}$ are given by
  $$
      x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
  $$

### Polynomial Expressions
- Quadratic expressions can be generalized as polynomial expressions in one variable. I.e., they are a specific type of polynomial expression in one variable.

- __*definition*__. A polynomial ${u}$ in one variable is an expression of the form:
  $$
      u_nx^n + u_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + u_1x + u_0,
  $$
  where the coefficients ${u_j}$ are rational numbers, and ${n}$ is a non-negative integer.
- If ${u_n \neq 0,}$ we call ${u_n}$ the _leading coefficient_ of ${u}$ and ${n}$ the _degree_ of ${u.}$ The expression ${u = 0}$ is called the _zero polynomial_. 
- By convention, the zero polynomial has leading coefficient ${0}$ and, according to mathematical convention, has degree ${-\infty.}$
- __*definition*__. Let ${u}$ be a polynomial expression in a single variable ${x.}$ Then:

  $$
      \text{deg}(u,x)
  $$

  corresponds to the degree of ${u}$ and

  $$
      \text{lc}(u,x)
  $$

  corresponds to the leading coefficient of ${u.}$ If the variable ${x}$ is clear from context, we use the shorthand notation ${\text{deg}(u)}$ and ${\text{lc}(u).}$

#### Multivariate Polynomials
- A _multivariate polynomial_ is a polynomial that contains one or more variables.
- __*definition*__. A _multivariate polynomial_ ${u}$ in the set of symbols ${\lbrace x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m \rbrace}$ is a finite sum with one or more monomial terms of the form

  $$
    c x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \ldots x_m^{n_m},
  $$

  where the coefficient ${c}$ is a rational number and the exponents ${n_j}$ are non-negative integers.
- **_example_**. ${x^2 - y^2}$
- **_example_**. ${mc^2}$
- **_example_**. ${a + \dfrac{1}{2}ax^2 + aby.}$
- **_example_**. ${ax^2 + bx + 3c.}$
- **_example_**. ${3x^2 + 4.}$
  - In this example, we see that all univariate polynomials are multivariate polynomials, since a multivariate polynomial is a polynomial that contains _one or more_ variables.

#### General Monomial Expressions

- __*definition*__. Let ${c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_r}$ be algebraic expressions and let ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m}$ be algebraic expressions that are not integers or fractions. A _general monomial expression_ (GME) in ${\lbrace x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m \rbrace}$ is an expression of the form

  $$
    c_1 c_2 \ldots c_r x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \ldots x_m^{n_m},
  $$

  where the exponents ${n_j}$ are non-negative integers and each ${c_i}$ does not contain an expression ${x_j}$ for ${j = 1,2,\ldots,m.}$
- In the definition above, the expressions ${x_j}$ are called _generalized variables_, and the expressions ${c_i}$ are called _generalized coefficients_. The expression ${x_1^{n_1} \ldots x_m^{n_m}}$ is called the _variable part_ of the monomial. If there aren't any generalized coefficients in the monomial, the coefficient is ${1.}$

#### General Polynomial Expression
- __*definition*__. A general polynomial expression (GPE) is a GME or a sum of GMEs.

## Cartesian Plane
- The _Cartesian plane_ is a plane constructed from two perpendicular real lines, called _axes_.
  - The horizontal line is called the ${x}$-axis. 
  - The vertical line is called the ${y}$-axis.
  - If we place a point ${p}$ on this plane, then that point can be represented as a pair ${(x_p,y_p),}$ where ${x_p}$ is the point's coordinate on the ${x}$-axis and ${y_p}$ is the point's coordinate on the ${y}$-axis.

import { Calc1 } from "@/components/Fig";

<Calc1 />

- The point of intersection of the two axes is called the _origin_, usually denoted by the letter ${O.}$
- The plane is divided into four regions called _quadrants_, often labeled ${\text{I}}$ through ${\text{IV}.}$
- The pair ${(x_p, y_p)}$ is an example of an _ordered pair_.
  - We call the coordinate ${x_p}$ the ordered pair's _abscissa_ and ${y_p}$ the _ordinate_.
  - For brevity, the notation ${p(x, y)}$ means that the point ${p}$ has the coordinates ${(x,y).}$

### The Distance Between Two Points
- Suppose we're given two points ${P(x_P, y_P)}$ and ${Q(x_Q, y_Q).}$ We want to know the distance between these two points.

import { DistanceBetweenPoints } from "@/components/Fig";

<DistanceBetweenPoints />

- We can solve this problem by employing one of the oldest theorems in mathematics:
- __*pythagorean theorem*__. In a right triangle, the lengths of the sides are related by the equation

  $$
      a^2 + b^2 = c^2,
  $$

  where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are the lengths of the sides forming the right triangle and ${c}$ is the length of the hyptonuse (the side opposite the right angle).
- So, if we suppose that the red line in our diagram is ${c,}$ then the length of that line is found by solving for ${c:}$
  $$
      c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
  $$
- But what are ${a}$ and ${b}$? They must be the lengths of the other sides of the right triangle:

import { DistanceBetweenPoints2 } from "@/components/Fig";

<DistanceBetweenPoints2 />

- Thus, we have the following formula.
  - __*distance formula*__. The distance ${d}$ between points ${(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${(x_2, y_2)}$ is given by

  $$
      d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.
  $$

### Midpoint Formula
- Given two points ${P(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${Q(x_2, y_2),}$ what is the midpoint of the line segment joining ${P}$ and ${Q}$?
- For example, consider the figure below. The midpoint is marked by the red point. What is the coordinate of this point?

import { MidpointFig } from "@/components/Fig";

<MidpointFig />

- Here, we apply the midpoint formula:
  - __*midpoint formula*__. Given points ${P(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${Q(x_2, y_2),}$ the midpoint of the line segment joining ${P}$ and ${Q}$ has the coordinates:

  $$
      \left( \dfrac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right).
  $$

## Real Functions
- A _real function_ is a function mapping real numbers to real numbers.

### Affine Functions
- In the sea of real functions, affine functions are among the most desirable. They're easy to understand because they're easy to gut &mdash; internally, they have at most two operations: multiplication and addition.
- __*definition*__. Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are real number constants. A function of the form
  $$
      f(x) = ax + b
  $$
  is called an _affine function_. In the case where ${a = 0,}$ then ${f(x) = b,}$ and we call ${f}$ a _constant function_. In the case where ${b = 0}$ and ${a \neq 0,}$ then ${f(x) = ax,}$ and we call ${f}$ a _linear function_.
  - The graph of an affine function ${f}$ is a continuous straight line.
  - If ${a \gt 0,}$ then ${f}$ is strictly increasing.
  - If ${a \lt 0,}$ then ${f}$ is strictly decreasing.
  - If ${a \neq 0,}$ then then ${f}$ has a unique zero ${x = -\dfrac{b}{a}.}$
  - To demonstrate these facts, consider the interactive figure below. Adjust the ${a}$ and ${b}$ values to see what happens to our line.

import { AffineFunctionLab } from "@/components/Fig";

<AffineFunctionLab />

- If ${f}$ is an affine function, then ${f}$ has a constant rate of change equal to the slope of its graph.
- Conversely, if a function ${f}$ has a constant rate of change, then ${f}$ must be an affine function.

### Quadratic Functions

- __*definition*__. Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ be real number constants, with ${a \neq 0.}$ A function of the form
  $$
      f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
  $$

  is called a _quadratic function_ with leading coefficient ${a.}$

<aside>
  The word _quadratic_ is derived from the Latin _quadratus_, meaning "square."
</aside>

- The graph of a quadratic function is called a _parabola_.
- Given the quadratic function ${f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c:}$
  - If ${a \gt 0,}$ then the parabola has a _local minimum_ at ${x = -\dfrac{b}{2a}}$ and the parabola is _convex_.
  - If ${a \lt 0,}$ then the parabola has a _local maximum_ at ${x = - \dfrac{b}{2a}}$ and the parabola is _concave_.
- All parabolas have a special point called the _vertex_. This point is given by:
  $$
      \left( -\dfrac{b}{2a}, \dfrac{4ac - b^2}{4a} \right).
  $$
- Below is an interactive plot of a quadratic.

import { QuadraticFunctionLab } from "@/components/Fig";

<QuadraticFunctionLab />

- A few observations playing with this plot:
  1. The graph of ${y = ax^2}$ is a parabola with its vertex at the origin. It is similar in shape to ${y = x^2.}$ 
  2. The parabola ${y = ax^2}$ opens upward if ${a \gt 0,}$ and downward if ${a \lt 0.}$
  3. The parabola ${y = ax^2}$ is narrower than ${y = x^2}$ if ${\lvert a \rvert \gt 1,}$ and wider than ${y = x^2}$ if ${\lvert a \rvert \lt 1.}$
- Importantly, through completing the square, the equation of the parabola ${y = ax^2 + bx + c}$ can always be written in the form
  $$
    y = (x - h)^2 + k,
  $$
  where ${(h,k)}$ is the parabola's vertex and the axis of symmetry is the line ${x = h.}$

#### The Discriminant
- The quantity ${b^2 - 4ac}$ is called the _discriminant_ of ${ax^2 + bx + c.}$
- The equation
  $$
      y = a\left(x + \dfrac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \dfrac{4ac - b^2}{4a}
  $$
  is called the _canonical equation_ of the parabola ${y = ax^2 + bx + c.}$
- Notice that the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line ${x = -\dfrac{b}{2a},}$ passing through the vertex. This line, called the _axis of symmetry_, is parallel to the ${y}$-axis. 

#### Quadratic Formula
- The quadratic formula provides a quick and easy way to find the roots of a polynomial equation.
- __*formula*__. Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ be constants in ${\reals.}$ The roots of the equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$ are given by the formula
  $$
      x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
  $$
- One can gain many insights about a particular quadratic by simply examining its determinant.
- __*corollary*__. Suppose ${u}$ is the quadratic ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$ with ${a \neq 0,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ as real constants. Then the following are true:
  1. If ${b^2 - 4ac = 0,}$ then ${u}$ is tangent to the ${x}$-axis and has one (repeated) real root.
  2. If ${b^2 - 4ac \gt 0,}$ then the parabola has two distinct real roots.
  3. If ${b^2 - 4ac \lt 0,}$ then the parabola has two complex roots.
  4. If ${b^2 - 4ac \gt 0,}$ then ${u}$ has the same sign as ${A.}$

#### The Square Function
- **_definition_**. The square function is a function of the form
  $$
      f(x) = x^2.
  $$
- Suppose ${f}$ is the square function ${f(x) = x^2.}$ Then:
  - ${f}$ is an even function; its graph is symmetric about the ${y}$-axis.
  - ${f}$ is an increasing function for ${x \gt 0.}$ 
  - ${f}$ is a decreasing function for ${x \lt 0.}$
  - ${f}$ has a minimum value at ${x = 0.}$
  - ${f(x)}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive or negative.

#### Even Power Functions
- The graphs of ${y = x^{2n + 2},}$ where ${n \in \natnums}$ (e.g., ${y = x^2,}$ ${y = x^4,}$ ${y = x^6,}$ etc.) look similar to one another.
- For ${-1 \leq x \leq 1,}$ the higher the exponent, the flatter the graph is along the ${x}$-axis.
- This follows from the fact that, where ${-1 \leq x \leq 1,}$ ${\lvert x \rvert \implies \ldots \lt x^6 \lt x^4 \lt x^2 \lt 1.}$

import { Pow2FuncLab } from "@/components/Fig";

<Pow2FuncLab />

### Cubic Functions
- __*definition*__. Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ ${c,}$ and ${d}$ be real number constants with ${a \neq 0.}$ A function of the form
  $$
    f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
  $$

  is called a _cubic function_.
- The graph of a cubic function is a _cubic curve_. As seen from its general form, the cubic curve depends on four parameters: ${a,}$ ${b,}$ ${c,}$ and ${d.}$ Where ${a = 1,}$ ${b = 0,}$ ${c = 0,}$ ${d = 0,}$ we get the simplest cubic:
  $$
    f(x) = x^3.
  $$
- The graph of the cubic function ${f(x) = x^3}$ is concave when ${x \lt 0}$ and convex when ${x \gt 0.}$ Examining the behavior of ${f(x) = x^3,}$ we see that ${f}$ is an increasing odd function.

#### The Cube Function
- **_definition_**. The cube function ${f}$ is defined as
  $$
    f(x) = x^3.
  $$
- Some properties of the cube function ${f:}$
  - ${f}$ is an odd function; its graph is symmetric about the origin.
  - ${f}$ is an increasing function for all real numbers.
  - ${f}$ has no maximum or minimum.
  - ${f(x)}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive.
  - ${f(x)}$ becomes unbounded negative as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative.

#### Odd Power Functions
- The graphs of ${y = x^{2n + 3},}$ ${n \in \natnums}$ (e.g., ${y = x^3,}$ ${y = x^5,}$ ${y = x^7,}$ etc.) look similar to one another. For ${-1 \leq x \leq 1,}$ the higher the exponent, the flatter the graph is to the ${x}$-axis, since
  $$
    \lvert x \rvert \lt 1 \implies \ldots \lt \lvert x^7 \rvert \lt \lvert x^5 \rvert \lt \lvert x^3 \rvert \lt 1.
  $$
- For ${\lvert x \rvert \geq 1,}$ the higher the exponent, the steeper the graph will be. This follows from the fact that
  $$
    \lvert x \rvert \gt 1 \implies \ldots \gt \lvert x^7 \rvert \gt \lvert x^5 \rvert \gt \lvert x^3 \rvert \gt 1.
  $$

### Polynomial Functions
- **_definition_**. A polynomial function ${f}$ is a function of the form
  $$
    f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0,
  $$
  where ${n \in \natnums}$ and each ${a_i}$ is a constant. If ${a_n \neq 0,}$ the _degree_ of the polynomial function is ${n.}$
- Functions of the form ${y = x^n}$ with ${n \in \natnums}$ (e.g., the square and cubic functions) are called _power functions_.
  - They are the simplest polynomial functions, and can be interpreted as the building blocks of more complex polynomial functions.

#### Graphs of Polynomial Functions
- Suppose ${f}$ is a polynomial function.
- If ${\deg(u) = 0}$ or ${\deg(u) = 1,}$ then the graph of ${f}$ is a line.
- If ${\deg(u) \geq 2,}$ then the graph of ${f}$ is an unbroken smooth curve.
- The graph of a polynomial function of degree ${n}$ has at most ${n - 1}$ turning points.
- Regardless of the degree, as ${\lvert x \rvert}$ gets very large, ${\lvert y \rvert}$ grows very large (except, of course, for the constant function).
- The following theorem, stated informally, is often helpful for getting a rough idea of a given polynomial's behavior.
- **_theorem_**. Suppose ${f}$ is a polynomial function of the form
  $$
    f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0
  $$
  with ${a_n \neq 0.}$ Then
  $$
    f(x) \approx a_n x^n
  $$
  when ${\lvert x \rvert}$ is very large.

### Rational Functions
- **_definition_**. A rational function ${r}$ is a function of the form
  $$
    r(x) = \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)},
  $$
  where ${f}$ and ${g}$ are [polynomial functions](#polynomial-functions).
- The graphs of rational functions differ from that of polynomial functions significantly because they employ the operation of _division_.
- That operation, as we all know, has a strict restriction: We cannot divide by ${0.}$
- To illustrate, consider the graph of ${f(x) = 1/x}$ (drag the slider to change the ${x}$ value of the point on the graph).

import { Rat1 } from "@/components/Fig";

<Rat1 />

- Notice that the graph comprises two separate curves, rather than the single continuous curve we see with polynomials.
- We call these curves the _branches_ or _arms_ of the rational function's graphs. The function ${f(x) = 1/x}$ has the following properties:
  1. ${f}$ is an odd function; its graph is symmetric about the origin.
  2. ${f}$ is decreasing for ${x \lt 0}$ and for ${x \gt 0.}$
  3. ${f}$ has no maximum or minimum.
  4. ${f(x)}$ approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive and from below as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative.
  5. ${f(x)}$ becomes unbounded negative as ${x}$ approaches zero from the left and unbounded positive as ${x}$ approaches zero from the right.
- Now consider the function ${g(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}.}$ This function has the following plot:

import { Rat2 } from "@/components/Fig";

<Rat2 />

- Some properties of the graph of ${g(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}:}$
  1. ${g}$ is an even function; its graph is symmetric about the ${y}$-axis.
  2. ${g}$ is increasing on ${(-\infty, 0)}$ and decreasing on ${(0, \infty).}$
  3. ${g}$ has no maximum or minimum.
  4. ${g(x)}$ approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive or negative.
  5. ${g(x)}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ approaches zero from the left or right.

#### Graphs of 1/ùë•‚Åø
- In general, the graph of ${f(x) = 1/x^n}$ where ${n \in \Z^+}$ will resemble either ${1/x^2}$ or ${1/x.}$
- If ${n}$ is an even integer, then ${f}$'s graph will resember ${1/x^2.}$
- If ${n}$ is an odd integer, then ${f}$'s graph will resember ${1/x.}$

### Exponential Functions

- **_definition_**. Let ${b}$ denote an arbitrary constant, with ${b \gt 0}$ and ${b \neq 1.}$ The exponential function ${f}$ with base ${b}$ is a function of the form
  $$
      f(x) = ab^{kx},
  $$
  where ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${k}$ are real constants.
- **_example_**. ${f(x) = 2^x.}$ Below is ${f}$'s graph.

import { Exp1 } from "@/components/Fig";

<Exp1 />

- Some observations of ${f(x) = 2^x}$ and its graph:
  1. The domain of ${f}$ is ${\reals.}$ The range is ${\reals^+.}$
  2. The ${y}$-intercept is ${1.}$ The graph never crosses the ${x}$-axis, so ${f}$ has no ${x}$-intercept.
  3. For ${x \gt 0,}$ ${f}$ increases rapidly.
  4. For ${x \lt 0,}$ ${f}$ rapidly approaches the ${x}$-axis. The ${x}$-axis is a horizontal asymptote for the graph; ${f}$ approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative.
  5. ${f}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive.
  6. The function is one-to-one.
- More generally, for the function ${f(x) = b^x}$ with ${b \gt 0}$ and ${b \neq 1,}$
  1. For ${b \gt 1,}$ ${f}$ approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative, and becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive.
  2. For ${0 \lt b \lt 1,}$ ${b^x}$ becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded negative and approaches zero from above as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive.

#### The Exponential Function ${y = e^x}$
- Euler's number ${e}$ is an irrational number:
  $$
    e = 2.7182818284\ldots
  $$
- This number is particularly special because it makes handling exponentials much simpler. The graph of ${f(x) = e^x:}$

import { Exp2 } from "@/components/Fig";

### Logarithmic Functions
- To study the logarithmic functions, we must first study logarithms as expressions and operators.

#### Logarithms
- **_definition_**. The expression
  $$
    \log_b x
  $$
  means, "the exponent to which ${b}$ must be raised to yield ${x.}$" We read the expression, "log base ${b}$ of ${x}$" or "the logarithm of ${x}$ to the base ${b.}$"
- The logarithm is a binary operator. It takes two arguments: First, a base ${b,}$ and second, some real number ${x:}$
  $$
    \log(b,x) \mapsto y
  $$
- When we evaluate this expression, we get a real number ${y}$ that satisfies the following relation:
  $$
    b^y = x.
  $$
- In other words, the logarithm answers the question, "What is the number I must raise ${b}$ to, such that I get ${x?}$" Following convention, instead of writing ${\log(b,x),}$ we will instead write:
  $$
    \log_b x.
  $$
- Using this notation, we state the following equivalence:
  $$
    y = \log_b x \iff x = b^y.
  $$
- The equation ${y = \log_b x}$ is in _logarithmic form_, and the equation ${x = b^y}$ is in _exponential form_. Some logarithms of a particular base are given special symbols as operators:

| Symbol  | Meaning                                                                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ${\ln}$ | ${\log_e}$ (log of base ${e}$, called the _natural logarithm_ or _natural log_). |
| ${\lg}$ | ${\log_2}$ (log of base ${2}$, called the _binary logarithm_ or _binary log_).   |

- In this text, we will use the following conventions: ${\log}$ is assumed to be ${\log_{10},}$ ${\ln}$ is the natural log, ${\lg}$ is the binary log, and all other logarithms will have a specified base.

#### Manipulating Logarithms
- The following properties are essential to working with logarithms efficiently and cleanly.
  <Cols of={2}>

  <div>

  - ${\log_n b = 1.}$
  - ${\log_n 1 = 0.}$
  - ${\log_n ab = \log_n a + \log_n b.}$
  - ${\log_n \frac{a}{b} = \log_n a - \log_n b.}$

  </div>
  <div>

  - ${\log_n \frac{1}{x} = - \log_n x.}$
  - ${\log_n x^r = r \log_n x}$ for all ${x \in \reals.}$
  - ${n^{\log_n x} = x.}$
  - ${\log_n n^x = x}$ for all ${x \in \reals.}$

  </div>

  </Cols>
- The following equation is another useful fact to keep in mind. As its name implies, this equation allows us to rewrite logarithms as logarithms of different bases.
  - __*change of base.*__ ${\log_a x = \dfrac{\log_b x}{\log_b a}.}$


#### Logarithmic Behavior
- Below are graphs of various logarithmic functions:

import {LogFig1} from "@/components/Fig";

<LogFig1/>

- Notice that ${f(x)}$ grows or increases _very_ slowly. It is always increasing as ${x}$ increases, just very, very slowly. Given a function of the form ${f(x) = \log_b x,}$ with ${b \gt 1,}$ we have the following properties:
  1. ${\text{dom}(f) = \reals^+}$ (all positive real numbers).
  2. ${\text{ran}(f) = \reals.}$
  3. There is no ${y}$-intercept.
  4. The ${x}$-intercept is ${1.}$
  5. The assymptote is ${x = 0}$ (i.e., ${y}$-axis).
  6. End behavior: ${f}$ becomes unbounded negative as ${x}$ approaches ${0}$ from the right and becomes unbounded positive as ${x}$ becomes unbounded positive. 

### Trigonometric Functions
<aside>

This section assumes some knowledge of classical trigonometry. _See_ [Geometry: Trigonometry](/pages/geometry#trigonometry). We will also use trigonometric identities liberally. _See_ [Geometry: Trigonometric Identities](/pages/geometry#trigonometric-identities).

</aside>

import {TrigFnAngles} from "@/components/Fig";

- __*definition*__. Let ${\theta}$ be an angle in standard position and let ${P(x,y)}$ be the point where the terminal side of ${\theta}$ intersects the unit circle. The trigonometric functions of ${\theta}$ are defined as follows:

  <Cols of={2}>

  $$
    \cos \theta = x \\[2em]
    \sin \theta = y \\[2em]
    \tan \theta = \dfrac{y}{x} ~~ (x \neq 0) \\[2em]
    \sec \theta = \dfrac{1}{x} ~~ (x \neq 0) \\[2em]
    \csc \theta = \dfrac{1}{y} ~~ (y \neq 0) \\[2em]
    \cot \theta = \dfrac{x}{y} ~~ (y \neq 0).
  $$
  <div>

  <TrigFnAngles/>

  </div>

  </Cols>

- To see the relationship between the trigonometric ratios and the ${xy}$-plane, consider the diagram below. Recall that the _unit circle_ is the graph of the equation ${x^2 + y^2 = 1.}$

import {UnitCircleTrig} from "@/components/Fig";

<UnitCircleTrig/>

- Above, we see an imposed triangle with sides ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c.}$ The ${x}$-coordinate is given by the length of ${c,}$ and the ${y}$-coordinate is given by the length of ${b.}$ We know that these lengths are given by the trigonometric ratios, sine and cosine, with respect to ${\theta.}$ Thus, we have:

$$
  x = \cos \theta, \\[1em] y = \sin \theta.
$$

#### Trigonometric Notational Conventions
- The expression ${\sin \theta}$ really means ${\sin(\theta),}$ ${\cos \theta}$ means ${\cos(\theta),}$ and so on. For historical reasons, the parentheses are omitted. Parentheses are also omitted in the multiplication of trigonometric functions. E.g., ${(\sin \theta)(\cos \theta)}$ is usually written ${\sin \theta \cos \theta.}$ Similarly, ${a(\sin b)}$ is reduced to ${a \sin b.}$

<aside>
Historically, the symbols ${\sin,}$ ${\cos,}$ etc., were abbreviations of sine, cosine, etc. These abbreviations appeared before we began interpreting the trigonometric ratios as functions, and as abbreviations, parentheses were uncalled for.   
</aside>

- Along the same lines, ${(\sin \theta)^n}$ is usually written ${\sin^n \theta.}$ Thus, the expression ${\sin^2 \theta}$ really means ${(\sin \theta)^2.}$ The one exception to this rule is when ${n = -1.}$ The expression ${\sin^{-1} \theta}$ denotes the _arcsine_ of ${\theta,}$ a function we will cover in a later section.

#### Periodic Functions
- The trigonometic functions are instances of a broader class of functions called _periodic functions_.
  - These are functions that exhibit cyclic behavior &mdash; they start at some initial state, undergo changes, then return back to their initial state; repeating the pattern over and over.
  - Cyclic behavior is seen throughout pure and applied mathematics: the Fourier transform, sound waves, digital signal processing, electrocardiograms (EKGs), computer graphics, etc.

- __*definition*__. A nonconstant function ${f}$ is _periodic_ if there is a number ${p \gt 0}$ such that

  $$
    f(x + p) = f(x)
  $$

  for all ${x}$ in the domain of ${f.}$ The smallest such ${p}$ is called the _period_ of ${f.}$
- Given the graph of a periodic function ${f,}$ the graph's _amplitude_ is the maximum height of the graph above the horizontal axis. 
- __*definition*__. Let ${f}$ be a periodic function and let ${m}$ and ${M}$ denote, respectively, the minimum and maximum values of the function. Then the amplitude of ${f}$ is the number

  $$
    \dfrac{M - m}{2}.
  $$

 

import {BasicSineWave} from "@/components/Fig";

#### The Sine Function
- The domain of the sine function, ${f(x) = \sin x,}$ is ${\reals.}$
- The range of the sine function is the closed interval ${[-1,1].}$ Thus, 

  $$
    -1 \leq \sin x \leq 1
  $$

  for all ${x \in \reals.}$
- The sine function is an odd periodic function, with a period of ${2 \pi.}$ Its amplitude is ${1.}$
- The graph of ${f(x) = \sin x}$ comprises repetitions, over the entire domain, of the basic sine wave: 

  <BasicSineWave/>

- As an odd function, ${f(x) = \sin x}$ is symmetric about the origin.
- The basic sine wave crosses the ${x}$-axis at the beginning, middle, and end of the basic cycle.
- The curve reaches the highest point a fourth of the way through the basic cycle and its lowest point three-fourths of the way.   

import {BasicCosineWave} from "@/components/Fig";

#### The Cosine Function
- The domain of the cosine function, ${f(x) = \cos x,}$ is ${\reals.}$
- The range of the cosine function is the closed interval ${[-1,1],}$ and we have  
  $$
    -1 \leq \cos x \leq 1,
  $$
  for all ${x \in \reals.}$ The cosine function is an even periodic function. The graph of ${f(x) = \cos x}$ comprises repetitions, over the entire domain, of the basic cosine wave:

  <BasicCosineWave/>

- As an even function, ${f(x) = \cos x}$ is symmetric about the ${y}$-axis.
- The basic cosine wave crosses the ${x}$-axis a fourth of the way through the basic cycle and again three-fourths of the way.
- The curve reaches its highest point at the beginning and end of the basic cycle and reaches its lowest point halfway through the basic cycle.

#### Properties of Sine & Cosine
- ${f(x) = \sin x}$ and ${g(x) = \cos x}$ are periodic functions with a period of ${2 \pi.}$
- The domain of each function is ${(-\infty, \infty)}$ and the range is ${[-1,1].}$ 
- The graph of ${y = \sin x}$ is symmetric about the origin, because it is an odd function.
- The graph of ${y = \cos x}$ is symmetric about the ${y}$-axis, because it is an even function.

import {SinePeriod} from "@/components/Fig";

#### The Period of a Function
- __*definition*__. The period ${P}$ of a periodic function ${f}$ is the number representing the interval such that ${f(x + P) = f(x).}$ That is, it is the number representing the shortest interval over which a function completes one full cycle.
- __*example*__. The period of sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant is ${2 \pi.}$
  - Below is a graph of ${f(x) = \sin x,}$ with its period annotated.
    <SinePeriod/>
- __*example*__. The period of tangent and cotangent is ${\pi.}$

#### Sinusoids
- __*definition*__. A function that has the same general shape as a sine or cosine function is known as a _sinusoidal function_ or _sinusoid_. The general forms of sinusoids are:
    $$
        \begin{aligned}
             y &= A \sin (Bx - C) + D, \\[1.5em]
             y &= A \cos (Bx - C) + D.
        \end{aligned}
    $$
- If we let ${C = 0}$ and ${D = 0}$ in the general form equations, we get:
    $$
      \begin{aligned}
         y &= A \sin (Bx) \\[1.5em]
         y &= A \cos (Bx).
      \end{aligned}
    $$
  The period is ${\dfrac{2 \pi}{B}.}$

import {SineAmplitude} from "@/components/Fig";

#### The Amplitude of a Function
- The _amplitude_ of a periodic function is the function's greatest distance from its resting position.
- __*definition*__. If we let ${C = 0}$ and ${D = 0}$ in the general form equations of the sine and cosine functions, we obtain the forms
    $$
        \begin{aligned}
            y &= A \sin (Bx), \\[1.5em]
            y &= A \cos (Bx).
        \end{aligned}
    $$
    The amplitude is ${A,}$ and the vertical height from the midline is ${\left\lvert A \right\rvert.}$
- Consider the following variations of ${f(x) = A \sin x,}$ with varying amplitude ${A:}$
  <SineAmplitude/>

#### Phase Shifts
- Given an equation in the forms
  $$
      \begin{aligned}
            f(x) &= A \sin (Bx - C) ~ \text{or} \\[1.5em]
            f(x) &= A \cos (Bx - C),
      \end{aligned}
  $$
  the value ${C/B}$ is the _phase shift_ and the value ${D}$ is the _vertical shift_.

import {ArcsinePlot} from "@/components/Fig";

#### The Arcsine Function
- __*definition.*__ The arcsine of ${x,}$ denoted ${\arcsin x}$ or ${\sin^{-1} x,}$ is the unique number ${y}$ in the interval ${[0, \pi]}$ such that ${\cos y = x.}$ That is,

  $$
    y = \arcsin x \iff y = \sin^{-1} x \iff \cos y = x. 
  $$

- Below is a plot of the arcsine function ${f(x) = \arcsin x.}$

  <ArcsinePlot/>

import {SeqPlot1} from "@/components/Fig";
import {EpsilonNeighborhood} from "@/components/Fig";

## Sequences
- __*definition.*__ A _sequence_ ${a}$ is a mapping from the natural numbers to the reals. That is, 
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
    \natnums &\phantom{\to} \reals \\
    a : N &\to R
  \end{aligned}
  $$
- Each ${y \in R}$ is called an _element_ or _member_ of the sequence, and each ${n \in N}$ is the element's _index_. 
- We may express sequences in a variety of ways. If we want to explicitly show elements of some infinite sequence ${a_n,}$ we may write 
  $$
    (a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots).
  $$
- If the sequence has an explicit formula, we may write that formula inside the parentheses:
  $$
    \left( \dfrac{1}{n} \right)_{n = 1}^{\infty} = \left( 1, \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{1}{3}, \dfrac{1}{4}, \dfrac{1}{5}, \ldots \right).
  $$
- If the first and last indices are clear from context, we may omit the sub- and super-scripts:
  $$
    \left( \dfrac{1}{n} \right).
  $$
- We can plot sequences just as we would plot real functions. With sequence plots, the "${y}$-axis" corresponds to the sequence members, and the "${x}$-axis" corresponds to their indices. Below is a plot of the sequence ${a_n = 1/x.}$

  <SeqPlot1/>

- If we imagine walking down the sequence from first to last (a fool's errand; as we'll never see the last), we find that each sequence member starts looking more and more like zero. They're never quite zero, but they're uncannily close. This phenomenon, a sequence's members tending towards a particular number, is captured by the notion of a _limit_. 

### Convergent Sequences
- __*definition.*__ A sequence ${(a_n)_{n \in \natnums}}$ is _convergent_ to a real number ${c}$ if for all ${\varepsilon \gt 0,}$ there exists an index ${N}$ such that, for all indices ${n \geq N,}$ ${\lvert a_n - c \rvert \lt \varepsilon.}$
- A convergent sequence is a sequence with the following properties: There is some number ${c}$ such that, given a positive number ${\varepsilon,}$ the sequence's members all tend towards ${c,}$ with the majority of sequence members gathering around ${c.}$ I.e., most members are in the interval ${(c-\varepsilon, c + \varepsilon).}$
  <EpsilonNeighborhood/>
- We call the interval ${(c - \varepsilon, c + \varepsilon)}$ the _epsilon neighborhood_ of ${c.}$

### Divergent Sequences
- If there is no number ${c}$ where the sequence members tend to congregate, then the sequence is _divergent_.
- __*definition.*__ Given a sequence ${a_n,}$ if ${a_n}$ is not convergent, then ${a_n}$ is _divergent_.

### Bounded Sequences
- __*definition.*__ A sequence ${(a_n)_{n \in \natnums}}$ is _bounded_ if there exists a ${C \in \reals,}$ such that, for all ${n \in \natnums,}$ ${\lvert a_n \rvert \leq C.}$ 
  - We can think of a bounded sequence as a sequence with all its members living in some interval ${[=C, C],}$ where ${C}$ is a real number. 

### Unbounded Sequences
- __*definition.*__ A sequence ${(a_n)_{n \in \natnums}}$ is _unbounded_ if there is no ${C \in \reals}$ such that, for all ${n \in \natnums,}$ ${\lvert a_n \rvert \leq C.}$

### Convergence Theorems
- __*theorem*__. If a sequence is convergent, then it is bounded. 
  - The converse is _not_ true. The fact that a sequence is bounded does not mean it is convergent. For example, the sequence ${(-1)^n}$ is bounded (its members oscillate between ${1}$ and ${-1}$), but it is not convergent.
  - The contrapositive, of course, is true. If a sequence is unbounded, then it is convergent.
- __*theorem*__. If a sequence ${a_n}$ is convergent, then there is only one limit ${c \in \reals.}$
  - I.e., if ${a_n}$ is convergent, ${\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = c,}$ where ${c \in \reals.}$

## Limits
- __*definition*__. Let ${f: x \mapsto y}$ be a function defined on an open interval about ${c,}$ except possibly at ${c}$ itself. We say that the limit of ${f}$ as ${x}$ approaches ${c}$ is ${L,}$ and denote it by
  $$
    \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L,
  $$
  if, for every ${\varepsilon \gt 0}$ there exists a ${\delta \gt 0}$ such that if ${0 \lt \lvert x - c \rvert \lt \delta,}$ then ${\lvert f(x) - L \rvert \lt \varepsilon.}$


### Limit Theorems
- Suppose ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$ are convergent sequences. Then the following laws hold:
  1. ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} (a_n + b_n) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n + \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n.}$
  2. ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} (a_n - b_n) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n - \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n.}$
  3. ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} (a_n \cdot b_n) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n \cdot \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n.}$
  4. ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left(\dfrac{a_n}{b_n}\right) = \dfrac{\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n}{\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n},}$ provided ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n \neq 0.}$

### Monotonicity of Sequences
- Given convergent sequences ${a_n}$ and ${b_n,}$ if ${a_n \leq b_n}$ for all ${n \in \natnums,}$ then ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n \leq \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n.}$
  - Be careful with this theorem. The implication is always ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n \leq \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n.}$ E.g., if ${a_n \lt b_n,}$ the implication is still ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n \leq \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n.}$ 

### Terminology of Real Intervals
- Because ${\reals}$ is ordered and infinite, we need robust terminology for describing any given subset of ${\reals.}$

#### Upper & Lower Bounds
- __*definition.*__ Let ${R}$ be a set of real numbers. An upper bound of ${R,}$ denoted ${u,}$ is a real number such that ${x \leq u}$ for all ${x \in R.}$  
  - __*example.*__ If ${R = [0,1],}$ then ${1, 1.1, 2, \pi, 10^{10}, \ldots}$ are all upper bounds.
  - A set of reals ${R}$ has infinitely many upper bounds. 
- __*definition.*__ Let ${R}$ be a set of real numbers. A lower bound of ${R,}$ denoted ${\ell,}$ is a real number such that ${x \geq \ell}$ for all ${x \in R.}$  
  - __*example.*__ If ${R = [-5,5],}$ then ${-5, -20/3, -10.3\overline{33}, -e, -10^{100}, \ldots}$ are all lower bounds.
  - A set of reals ${R}$ has infinitely many lower bounds.
- A lower/upper bound may or may not be included in the set ${R.}$
  - __*example.*__ If ${R = (0,1],}$ then ${0}$ is a lower bound, but is not included in ${R.}$

#### Maximum & Minimum
- __*definition.*__ Let ${R}$ be a set of reals. If ${u}$ is an upper bound of ${R,}$ and ${u \in R,}$ then ${u}$ is called the _maximum_ of ${R.}$
- __*definition.*__ Let ${R}$ be a set of reals. If ${\ell}$ is a lower bound of ${R,}$ and ${\ell \in R,}$ then ${\ell}$ is called the _minimum_ of ${R.}$

#### Supremum & Infimum
- Let ${R}$ be a set of reals. If ${u}$ is an upper bound of ${R,}$ and ${u}$ is the smallest upper bound of ${R,}$ then ${u}$ is called the _supremum_ of ${R.}$ We denote the supremum of ${R}$ with
  $$
    \sup R.
  $$
  - The supremum is also called the _least upper bound_, denoted
    $$
      \text{LUB}~R.
    $$ 
- Let ${R}$ be a set of reals. If ${\ell}$ is a lower bound of ${R,}$ and ${\ell}$ is the greatest lower bound of ${R,}$ then ${\ell}$ is called the _infimum_ of ${R.}$ We denote the infimum of ${R}$ with
  $$
    \inf R.
  $$
  - The infimum is also called the _greatest lower bound_, denoted
  $$
    \text{GLB}~R.
  $$

### Cauchy Sequences
- 


### The Sandwich Theorem
- Let ${a_n,}$ ${b_n,}$ and ${c_n}$ be sequences. If ${a_n \leq c_n \leq b_n,}$ and ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n,}$ then ${c_n}$ is convergent with ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} c_n = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} b_n.}$

## The Derivative
- Suppose curve ${C}$ has equation ${y = f(x).}$ On ${C,}$ there exists a point ${A(a, f(a)),}$ and a point ${B(b, f(b)).}$ We can draw a line that passes through ${A}$ and ${B.}$ That line is called the _secant line_ ${AB.}$ We can bring ${B}$ closer and closer to ${A}$ by making ${b}$ closer and closer to ${a.}$ The closer we bring ${B}$ to ${A,}$ the more ${AB}$ looks like a line _tangent_ to ${A.}$ 
- Numerically, we can compute the _slope_ of ${AB,}$ call it ${m_{AB}:}$

  $$
    m_{AB} = \dfrac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.
  $$

- If we bring ${b}$ closer and closer to ${a,}$ and ${m_{AB}}$ approaches some number ${k,}$ then that number ${k}$ corresponds to the slope of the line _tangent_ to ${A.}$ That is, the line tanget to ${A}$ is the limiting position of secant line ${AB}$ as ${B}$ approaches ${A.}$
- __*definition*__. The _tangent line_ to the curve ${y = f(x)}$ at the point ${P(a, f(a))}$ is the line through ${P}$ with slope

  $$
    m = \lim_{x \to a} \dfrac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
  $$

  provided the limit exists.
- To illustrate, consider the interactive diagram below. The ${x_B}$ slider corresponds to the ${x}$-coordinate of ${B.}$ Changing this value will move ${B}$ along the curve ${y = x^2.}$ Notice that as ${B}$ gets closer to ${A}$ (which we can do by decreasing the distance between ${A}$ and ${B;}$ i.e., bringing ${x_B}$ closer and closer to ${x = -1,}$ the ${x}$-coordinate of ${A}$), the more the line looks as if it's tangent to ${A.}$  

  <TangentLineLab/>

- The slope of the line is shown above by the value ${m.}$ If we try and place ${B}$ directly over ${A,}$ we get the value ${-1.99.}$ The correct value is ${-2,}$ but because of the limitations of floating point arithmetic on a computer, we get something very close to it (in this case, ${-1.99}$). 
- Now let's try finding the derivative of ${y = x^2}$ at the point ${A(-1,1)}$ algebraically. We have ${a = -1,}$ and ${f(x) = x^2,}$ so the slope is:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
    m &= \lim_{x \to -1} \dfrac{f(x) - f(-1)}{x - (-1)} \\[2em]
    &= \lim_{x \to -1} \dfrac{x^2 - 1}{x + 1} \\[2em]
    &= \lim_{x \to -1} \dfrac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x + 1} \\[2em]
    &= \lim_{x \to -1} (x - 1) \\[2em]
    &= -1 - 1 \\[2em]
    &= -2.
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we find that an equation of the tangent line at ${(-1,1)}$ is:

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      y - 1 &= -2(x - (-1)) \\[1em]
      &= -2(x + 1)
    \end{aligned}  \\[1em]
      \text{or} \\[1em]
      y = -2x - 1.
  $$

### The Derivative as a Function
- We can interpret the derivative as a function:
  $$
    f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}.
  $$ 

### Derivative Notations
- Given a function ${f,}$ the following notations are equivalent:
  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      f'(x) &= y' \\[1.5em]
      &= \dfrac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x} \\[1.5em]
      &= \dfrac{\text{d}f}{\text{d}x} \\[1.5em]
      &= \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} f(x) \\[1.5em]
      &= D f(x) \\[1.5em]
      &= D_x f(x) \\[1.5em]
      &= \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.
    \end{aligned}
  $$
- If we ant to indicate the value of a derivative ${\dfrac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}}$ at a specific number ${a,}$ we use the notation:
  $$
    \left.\dfrac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}\right\rvert_{x = a}
  $$

### Differentiability
- __*definition*__. A function ${f}$ is _differentiable_ at ${a}$ if ${f'(a)}$ exists. It is differentiable on an open interval ${(a,b)}$ if it is differentiable at every number in the interval.

### Differentiability & Continuity
- __*definition*__. If a function ${f}$ is differentiable at ${a,}$ then ${f}$ is _continuous_ at ${a.}$

### Higher Derivatives
- If ${f}$ is a differentiable function, then its derivative ${f'}$ is also a function, so ${f'}$ may have a derivative of its own, denoted ${(f')' = f''.}$ We call ${f''}$ the _second derivative_ of ${f.}$ Further, since ${f''}$ is a function, ${f''}$ may have a derivative as well, in which case ${(f'')' = f'''.}$ We call this the third derivative of ${f.}$ This pattern continues.  
- We can use Leibniz notation to denote the higher-order derivatives:
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \left( \dfrac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x} \right) = \dfrac{\text{d}^2 y}{\text{d}x^2}. 
  $$ 

## Differentiation Rules
### Derivative of a Constant Function
- __*theorem*__. Where ${c}$ is a constant,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} c = 0.
  $$

### Derivatives of Power Functions
- __*theorem*__. Where ${x}$ is a variable,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} (x) = 1.
  $$ 
- __*theorem*__. Where ${n}$ is a real number,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \left( x^n \right) = n x^{n - 1}.
  $$

### The Constant Multiple Rule 
- Where ${c}$ is a constant and ${f}$ is a differentiable function,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \left( c f(x) \right) = c \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} f(x).
  $$

### The Sum Rule
- Where ${f}$ and ${g}$ are differentiable functions,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \left( f(x) + g(x) \right) = \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} f(x) + \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} g(x).
  $$


### The Difference Rule
- Where ${f}$ and ${g}$ are differentiable functions,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \left( f(x) - g(x) \right) = \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} f(x) - \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} g(x).
  $$

### Derivatives of Exponential Functions
- __*definition*__. ${e}$ is the number such that
  $$
    \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{e^h - 1}{h} = 1.
  $$
- __*theorem*__. Where ${e}$ is Euler's number,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} (e^x) = e^x.
  $$ 

### The Product Rule
- __*theorem*__. Where ${f}$ and ${g}$ are differentiable functions,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \left( f(x) g(x) \right) = f(x) \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} g(x) + g(x) \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} f(x).
  $$
  Alternatively, in Newton's notation, where ${a = f(x)}$ and ${b = g(x),}$
  $$
    (ab)' = ab' + ba'.
  $$

### The Quotient Rule
- __*theorem*__. Where ${f}$ and ${g}$ are differentiable functions,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \left( \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right) 
    = \dfrac{g(x) \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} f(x) - f(x) \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} g(x)}{\left( g(x) \right)^2 }
  $$
  Alternatively, in Newton's notation, where ${a = f(x)}$ and ${b = g(x),}$
  $$
    \left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)' = \dfrac{ba' - ab'}{b^2}.
  $$

### Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
- The table below outlines the derivatives of the trigonometric functions.
  | ${f(x)}$   | ${f'(x)}$          |
  | ---------- | ------------------ |
  | ${\sin x}$ | ${\cos x}$         |
  | ${\cos x}$ | ${- \sin x}$       |
  | ${\tan x}$ | ${\sec^2 x}$       |
  | ${\csc x}$ | ${-\csc x \cot x}$ |
  | ${\sec x}$ | ${\sec x \tan x}$  |
  | ${\cot x}$ | ${- \csc x}$       |
- There are two special trigonometric limits that are often helpful to solving problems:
  $$
    \lim\limits_{\theta \to 0} \dfrac{\sin \theta}{\theta} = 1.
  $$ 
  and
  $$
    \lim\limits_{\theta \to 0} \dfrac{\cos \theta - 1}{\theta} = 0.
  $$

### The Chain Rule
- __*theorem*__. If ${g}$ is differentiable at ${x}$ and ${f}$ is differentiable at ${g(x),}$ then the composite function ${F = f \circ g}$ defined by ${F(x) = f(g(x))}$ is differentiable at ${x.}$ ${F'}$ is given by the product:
  $$
    F'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).
  $$ 
  Or, in Leibniz notation, where ${y = f(u)}$ and ${u = g(x)}$ are both differentiable functions,
  $$
    \dfrac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x} = \dfrac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}u} \dfrac{\text{d}u}{\text{d}x}.
