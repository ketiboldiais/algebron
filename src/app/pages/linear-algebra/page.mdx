# Linear Algebra

## Vectors
A vector is a mathematical object that can be added to another vector or multiplied by a scalar to produce another vector. This general definition yields numerous examples:

1. __Geometric Vectors.__ We can think of a vector as a geometric object with a magnitude (a line of given length) and a direction (an arrowhead). For example, consider two vectors ${a = [3,3]}$ and ${b = [4,1].}$ The sum of these vectors is ${a + b = [3 + 4, 3 + 1],}$ which reduces to ${[7,4].}$ Geometrically:

    <LA1/>

    Similarly, we can _scale_ the geometric vector, which will still yield a vector, longer, shorter, or just the same.

    <LA3/>

2. __Polynomials.__ Polynomials may also be interpreted as vectors. Consider the two polynomials:

    $$
        3x^2 + 4x - 1 \\
        4x^2 - 2x + 2
    $$

    We can represent these expressions as the vectors ${[3,4,-1]}$ and ${[4,-2,2],}$ where the polynomials' coefficients comprise the vector components. Adding these two vectors corresponds to adding the two polynomials, the sum of which is itself a polynomial (i.e., a vector). Thus, 

    $$
        [3,4,-1] + [4,-2,2] = [7,2,1]
    $$

    maps to the polynomial

    $$
        7x + 2x + 1.
    $$

    As an aside, recall that if we plot the two polynomials, the point where they intersect is the solution to the polynomial system. We will revisit this curiousity in later sections.

    <LA2/>

3. __Audio Signals.__ Audio signals can also be interpreted as vectors. We can add audio signals together to produce another audio signal, and we can also scale them to produce yet another. 

    <LA4/>

4. __Tuples.__ More abstractly, elements of ${\reals^n}$ (tuples, or arrays, of ${n}$ real numbers) are vectors. 
    
## Systems of Linear Equations
Many problems in mathematics can be reduced to systems of linear equations. Linear algebra provides us the tools for solving these systems.

> __Definition.__ The system
> 
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
>     a_{1,1}x_1 &+ &\ldots &+ a_{1,n}x_n = b_1 \\
>     &\vdots & &\vdots  \\
>     a_{m,1}x_1 &+ &\ldots &+ a_{m,n}x_n = b_n
> \end{aligned}
> $$
> 
> is called a __system of linear equations__, where ${a_{i,j}, b_{i} \in \reals}$ and each ${x_i}$ is a real number called an _unknown_ of the system.

Given a system of linear equations ${S,}$ each ${n}$-tuple ${(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \reals^n}$ that satisfies ${S}$ is called a _solution_ of ${S.}$ In a system with two unknowns ${x_1}$ and ${x_2,}$ each linear equation defines a line on the ${x_1}$-${x_2}$ plane. E.g., 

$$
    4x_1 + 4x_2 = 5 \\
    2x_1 - 4x_2 = 1
$$

is such a system. Note that we chose the variables ${x_1}$ and ${x_2}$ arbitrarily. We could've just used ${x}$ and ${y:}$

$$
    4x + 4y = 5 \\
    2x - 4y = 1.
$$

Notice that these are simple linear equations. Solving for ${y:}$

$$
    y = -x + \dfrac{5}{4} \\[1em]
    y = \dfrac{x}{2} - \dfrac{1}{4}.
$$

The point where these lines intersect is a solution to the system. In this case, the point ${(1, \frac{1}{4}).}$ Thus, the system above has the __solution space__ of ${\lbrace (1, \frac{1}{4}) \rbrace.}$

<LA5/>

We can represent a system of linear equations with matrices. We place the coefficients ${a_{i,j}}$ into vectors,

$$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{1,1} \\ \vdots \\ a_{m,1}
    \end{bmatrix}
    x_1 
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{1,2} \\ \vdots \\ a_{m,2}
    \end{bmatrix}
    x_2 
    + 
    \ldots
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{1,n} \\ \vdots \\ a_{m,n}
    \end{bmatrix}
    x_n 
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_m
    \end{bmatrix},
$$

then place the vectors into matrices

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{1,1} &\ldots &a_{1,n} \\
    \vdots   &~     \vdots &\vdots \\
    a_{m,1} &\ldots &a_{m,n}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{aligned}

    \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_m
    \end{bmatrix}.
$$

## Matrices
A matrix can be thought of as an array of arrays. They allow us to compactly represent a system of linear equations. 

> __Definition.__ Let ${m,n \in \N.}$ A real-valued ${(m,n)}$ matrix ${\bold{A}}$
> is an ${m \cdot n}$ tuple of elements ${a_{i,j},}$ ${i = 1, \ldots, m,}$ ${j =
> 1, \ldots, n.}$ This tuple is ordered as a rectangle of ${m}$ rows and ${n}$
> columns:
> 
> $$
>     \bold{A} = 
>     \begin{bmatrix}
>     a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \ldots & a_{1,n} \\
>     a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \ldots & a_{2,n} \\
>     \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots & \vdots \\
>     a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \ldots & a_{m,n} 
>     \end{bmatrix},
>     ~~ a_{i,j} \in \R.
> $$
> We call ${i}$ the _row index_, and ${j}$ the _column index_.

Some additional terminology: A ${(1,n)}$ matrix is called a __row vector__, and a ${(m,1)}$ matrix is called a __column vector__.

__*example*__. In programming, we can represent a row vector with a simple array:

~~~ts
let R = [1,2,3,4]
~~~

__*example*__. A matrix would be an array of arrays:

~~~ts
let M = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
]
~~~

__*example*__. A column vector would be an array of one-element arrays: 

~~~ts
let C = [[1],[2],[3]]
~~~

### Matrix Addition
To add two matrices, we add each element of one matrix to the corresponding element (the element of the same indices) in the other matrix (element-wise sum).

__Definition.__ Let ${\bold{A} \in \R^{m \times n},}$ and let ${\bold{B} \in \R^{m \times n}.}$ Then the sum ${\bold{A} + \bold{B}}$ is defined as:

$$
    \bold{A} + \bold{B} := 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{1,1} + b_{1,1} & \ldots & a_{1,n} + b_{1,n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    a_{m,1} + b_{m,1} & \ldots & a_{m,n} + b_{m,n}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \in
    \reals^{m \times n}.
$$

__*example*__. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3 & 0 & 3 \\
    5 & 7 & 4 \\
    2 & 1 & 8
    \end{bmatrix}
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 5 \\
    4 & 1 & 4 \\
    3 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3 + 1 & 0 + 2 & 3 + 5 \\
    5 + 4 & 7 + 1 & 4 + 4 \\
    2 + 3 & 1 + 0 & 8 + 1
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
    4 & 2 & 8 \\
    9 & 8 & 8 \\
    5 & 1 & 9
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}.
