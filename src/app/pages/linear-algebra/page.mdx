# Linear Algebra

## Vectors
A vector is a mathematical object that can be added to another vector or multiplied by a scalar to produce another vector. This general definition yields numerous examples:

1. __Geometric Vectors.__ We can think of a vector as a geometric object with a magnitude (a length) and a direction (an arrowhead). For example, consider two vectors ${a = [3,3]}$ and ${b = [4,1].}$ The sum of these vectors is ${a + b = [3 + 4, 3 + 1],}$ which reduces to ${[7,4].}$ Geometrically:

    <LA1/>

    Similarly, we can _scale_ the geometric vector, which will still yield a vector.

    <LA3/>

2. __Polynomials.__ Polynomials may also be interpreted as vectors. Consider the two polynomials:

    $$
        3x^2 + 4x - 1 \\
        4x^2 - 2x + 2
    $$

    We can think of these two polynomials as the vectors ${[3,4,-1]}$ and ${[4,-2,2],}$ where the polynomials' coefficients comprise the vector components. Adding these two vectors corresponds to adding the two polynomials, the sum of which is itself a polynomial. Thus, 

    $$
        [3,4,-1] + [4,-2,2] = [7,2,1]
    $$

    maps to the polynomial

    $$
        7x + 2x + 1.
    $$

    As an aside, recall that if we plot the two polynomials, the point where they intersect is the solution to the polynomial system. We will revisit this curiousity in later sections.

3. __Audio Signals.__ Audio signals can also be interpreted as vectors. We can add audio signals together to produce another audio signal, and we can also scale them to produce yet another.

4. __Tuples.__ More abstractly, elements of ${\reals^n}$ (tuples, or arrays, of ${n}$ real numbers) are vectors. 
    
## Systems of Linear Equations
Many problems in mathematics can be reduced to systems of linear equations. Linear algebra provides us the tools for solving these systems.

>     a_{m,1}x_1 &+ &\ldots &+ a_{m,n}x_n = b_n

Given a system of linear equations ${S,}$ each ${n}$-tuple ${(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \reals^n}$ that satisfies ${S}$ is called a _solution_ of ${S.}$
