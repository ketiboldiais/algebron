## 1D Motion
- 1D motion is motion along a straight line.
- The principles and concepts of 1D motion will be later extended to 2 and 3D motion.

### Position
- __*definition: position.*__ Let ${p}$ be some object. If ${p}$ exists in one-dimensional space ${\reals,}$ then ${p}$'s _position_ is an ${x \in \reals,}$ relative to some _reference point_ ${\mathscr{O}.}$ If ${p}$ exists in two-dimensional space ${\reals^2,}$ then ${p}$'s position is a pair ${(x,y) \in \reals^2,}$ again relative to some reference point ${\mathscr{O}.}$ If ${p}$ exists in three-dimensional space, then ${p}$'s position is a triple ${(x,y,z) \in \reals^3}$ (relative to some reference point ${\mathscr{O}.}$)

### Displacement
- __*definition: displacement.*__ Suppose an object ${p}$ has an initial position ${x_1}$ and a final position ${x_2.}$ Then the change from position ${x_1}$ to ${x_2}$ is called the _displacement_ of ${p,}$ denoted ${\Delta x,}$ where     
$$
    \Delta x = x_2 - x_1.
$$
- Displacement is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.

### Average Velocity
- __*definition*__. _Average velocity_, denoted ${v_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of an object's displacement ${\Delta x}$ over a particular time interval ${\Delta t.}$
    $$
        v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
        = \dfrac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}.
    $$
    Above, ${t_2}$ is the time when the object's position is at ${x_2,}$ and ${t_1}$ is the time when the object's position is at ${x_1.}$
- In a graph of ${x}$ versus ${t,}$ where ${x}$ corresponds to position and ${t}$ to time, the _slope_ of the secant line connecting two points on the ${x(t)}$ curve corresponds to ${v_{\text{avg}}.}$
- Like displacement, ${v_{\text{avg}}}$ is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.  
- ${v_{\text{avg}}}$ always has the same sign as ${\Delta x}$ because ${\Delta t}$ is always positive.

### Average Speed
- __*definition*__. _Average speed_, denoted ${s_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of the total distance an object travels over a particular time interval ${\Delta t.}$
- Average speed is a _scalar quantity_ &mdash; it has a magnitude but no direction (ergo, no algebraic sign).

### Instantaneous Velocity
- __*definition*__. A moving object's _instantaneous velocity_ (or simply _velocity_), denoted ${v,}$ is
    $$
        v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
        = \dfrac{\text{d} x}{\text{d} t}.
    $$
- In physics, the term _speed_ refers to the magnitude of ${v.}$
- A common unit for velocity is ${\text{m}/\text{s}}$ (meters per second).

### Average Acceleration
- __*definition*__. An object's _average acceleration_, denoted ${a_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of a change in velocity ${\Delta v}$ to the time interval ${\Delta t}$ in which the change occurs:
  $$
    a_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
    = \dfrac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1}
  $$ 
  where ${v_2}$ is the object's velocity at time ${t_2,}$ and ${v_1}$ at time ${t_1.}$
- ${a_{\text{avg}}}$ is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.
- The algebraic sign of ${a_{\text{avg}}}$ indicates the direction of ${a_{\text{avg}}.}$ 

### Instantaneous Acceleration
- __*definition*__. An object's _instantaneous acceleration_ (or simply _acceleration_), is
    $$
        a = \dfrac{\text{d} v}{\text{d} t}
        = \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} \left( \dfrac{\text{d}x}{\text{d}t} \right)
        = \dfrac{\text{d}^2 x}{\text{d}t^2}.
    $$
    That is, an object's acceleration at any instant is the second derivative of its position ${x(t)}$ with respect to time.
- Acceleration is commonly measured in ${\text{m}/\text{s}^2}$ (meters per second squared).
