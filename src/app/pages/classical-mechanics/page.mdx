## 1D Motion
- 1D motion is motion along a straight line.
- The principles and concepts of 1D motion will be later extended to 2 and 3D motion.

### Position
- __*definition: position.*__ Let ${p}$ be some particle. If ${p}$ exists in one-dimensional space ${\reals,}$ then ${p}$'s _position_ is an ${x \in \reals,}$ relative to some _reference point_ ${\mathscr{O}.}$ If ${p}$ exists in two-dimensional space ${\reals^2,}$ then ${p}$'s position is a pair ${(x,y) \in \reals^2,}$ again relative to some reference point ${\mathscr{O}.}$ If ${p}$ exists in three-dimensional space, then ${p}$'s position is a triple ${(x,y,z) \in \reals^3}$ (relative to some reference point ${\mathscr{O}.}$)

### Displacement
- __*definition: displacement.*__ Suppose a particle ${p}$ has an initial position ${x_1}$ and a final position ${x_2.}$ Then the change from position ${x_1}$ to ${x_2}$ is called the _displacement_ of ${p,}$ denoted ${\Delta x,}$ where     
$$
    \Delta x = x_2 - x_1.
$$
- Displacement is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.

### Average Velocity
- __*definition*__. _Average velocity_, denoted ${v_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of a particle's displacement ${\Delta x}$ over a particular time interval ${\Delta t.}$
    $$
        v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
        = \dfrac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}.
    $$
    Above, ${t_2}$ is the time when the particle's position is at ${x_2,}$ and ${t_1}$ is the time when the particle's position is at ${x_1.}$
- In a graph of ${x}$ versus ${t,}$ where ${x}$ corresponds to position and ${t}$ to time, the _slope_ of the secant line connecting two points on the ${x(t)}$ curve corresponds to ${v_{\text{avg}}.}$
- Like displacement, ${v_{\text{avg}}}$ is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.  
- ${v_{\text{avg}}}$ always has the same sign as ${\Delta x}$ because ${\Delta t}$ is always positive.

### Average Speed
- __*definition*__. _Average speed_, denoted ${s_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of the total distance a particle travels over a particular time interval ${\Delta t.}$
- Average speed is a _scalar quantity_ &mdash; it has a magnitude but no direction (ergo, no algebraic sign).

### Instantaneous Velocity
- __*definition*__. A moving particle's _instantaneous velocity_ (or simply _velocity_), denoted ${v,}$ is
    $$
        v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
        = \dfrac{\text{d} x}{\text{d} t}.
    $$
- In physics, the term _speed_ refers to the magnitude of ${v.}$
- A common unit for velocity is ${\text{m}/\text{s}}$ (meters per second).

### Average Acceleration
- __*definition*__. An particle's _average acceleration_, denoted ${a_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of a change in velocity ${\Delta v}$ to the time interval ${\Delta t}$ in which the change occurs:
  $$
    a_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
    = \dfrac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1}
  $$ 
  where ${v_2}$ is the particle's velocity at time ${t_2,}$ and ${v_1}$ at time ${t_1.}$
- ${a_{\text{avg}}}$ is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.
- The algebraic sign of ${a_{\text{avg}}}$ indicates the direction of ${a_{\text{avg}}.}$ 

### Instantaneous Acceleration
- __*definition*__. An particle's _instantaneous acceleration_ (or simply _acceleration_), is
    $$
        a = \dfrac{\text{d} v}{\text{d} t}
        = \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} \left( \dfrac{\text{d}x}{\text{d}t} \right)
        = \dfrac{\text{d}^2 x}{\text{d}t^2}.
    $$
    That is, a particle's acceleration at any instant is the second derivative of its position ${x(t)}$ with respect to time.
- Acceleration is commonly measured in ${\text{m}/\text{s}^2}$ (meters per second squared).

### g Units
- Large accelerations are sometimes expressed in ${\text{g}}$ units:
	$$
		1 \text{g} = 9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2.
	$$

### Acceleration Signum
- If the signs of the velocity and acceleration of a particle are the same, the speed of the particle increases. If the signs are opposite, the speed decreases.

### Constant Acceleration
Constant acceleration is a common case of movement. E.g., while stopped at a red light, you accelerate your car at an approximately constant rate when the light turns green.

The following equations mathematically model this case. The equations only apply to constant acceleration.
- __*equation*__. Where ${a}$ is constant,
	$$
		a = a_\text{avg} = \dfrac{v_1 - v_0}{t_1 - t_0},
	$$
	where ${v_1}$ is the velocity at time ${t_1}$ and ${v_0}$ is the velocity at time ${t_0.}$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{x_1 - x_0}{t_1 - t_0}.
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		x_1 = x_0 + v_{\text{avg}}t.
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_1).
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
  $$
		v_{\text{avg}} = v_0 + \dfrac{1}{2}at. 
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		x_1 - x_0 = v_0t + \dfrac{1}{2}at^2.
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		v_1^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x_1 - x_0).
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		x_1 - x_0 = \dfrac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_1)t.
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		x_1 - x_0 = vt - \dfrac{1}{2}at^2.
	$$

### Free-fall Acceleration
- If we toss an object either up or down and eliminate the effects of air on the object's flight, we would find that the object accelerates downward at a certain constant rate.	
- We call this rate _free-fall acceleration_, of magnitude ${g.}$
  - Free-fall acceleration is independent of the object's mass, density, or shape â€” it is the same for all objects.
  - At sea-level in Earth's midlatitudes, the value is roughly ${9.807 \text{m}/\text{s}^2.}$
