## Introduction
These notes cover my first year course in classical mechanics. The notes assume familiarity with the following concepts:

1. Basic linear algebra (_See_ [Linear Algebra Notes: Physical Vectors](/pages/linear-algebra#physical-vectors)). 
2. Differential Calculus (_See_ [Calculus Notes](/pages/calculus)).
2. Integral Calculus (_See_ [Calculus Notes](/pages/calculus)).

## 1D Motion
- 1D motion is motion along a straight line.
- The principles and concepts of 1D motion will be later extended to 2 and 3D motion.

### Position
- __*definition: position.*__ Let ${p}$ be some particle. If ${p}$ exists in one-dimensional space ${\reals,}$ then ${p}$'s _position_ is an ${x \in \reals,}$ relative to some _reference point_ ${\mathscr{O}.}$ If ${p}$ exists in two-dimensional space ${\reals^2,}$ then ${p}$'s position is a pair ${(x,y) \in \reals^2,}$ again relative to some reference point ${\mathscr{O}.}$ If ${p}$ exists in three-dimensional space, then ${p}$'s position is a triple ${(x,y,z) \in \reals^3}$ (relative to some reference point ${\mathscr{O}.}$)

### Displacement
- __*definition: displacement.*__ Suppose a particle ${p}$ has an initial position ${x_1}$ and a final position ${x_2.}$ Then the change from position ${x_1}$ to ${x_2}$ is called the _displacement_ of ${p,}$ denoted ${\Delta x,}$ where     
$$
    \Delta x = x_2 - x_1.
$$
- Displacement is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.

### Average Velocity
- __*definition*__. _Average velocity_, denoted ${v_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of a particle's displacement ${\Delta x}$ over a particular time interval ${\Delta t.}$
    $$
        v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
        = \dfrac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}.
    $$
    Above, ${t_2}$ is the time when the particle's position is at ${x_2,}$ and ${t_1}$ is the time when the particle's position is at ${x_1.}$
- In a graph of ${x}$ versus ${t,}$ where ${x}$ corresponds to position and ${t}$ to time, the _slope_ of the secant line connecting two points on the ${x(t)}$ curve corresponds to ${v_{\text{avg}}.}$
- Like displacement, ${v_{\text{avg}}}$ is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.  
- ${v_{\text{avg}}}$ always has the same sign as ${\Delta x}$ because ${\Delta t}$ is always positive.

### Average Speed
- __*definition*__. _Average speed_, denoted ${s_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of the total distance a particle travels over a particular time interval ${\Delta t.}$
- Average speed is a _scalar quantity_ &mdash; it has a magnitude but no direction (ergo, no algebraic sign).

### Instantaneous Velocity
- __*definition*__. A moving particle's _instantaneous velocity_ (or simply _velocity_), denoted ${v,}$ is
    $$
        v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
        = \dfrac{\text{d} x}{\text{d} t}.
    $$
- In physics, the term _speed_ refers to the magnitude of ${v.}$
- A common unit for velocity is ${\text{m}/\text{s}}$ (meters per second).

### Average Acceleration
- __*definition*__. An particle's _average acceleration_, denoted ${a_{\text{avg}},}$ is the ratio of a change in velocity ${\Delta v}$ to the time interval ${\Delta t}$ in which the change occurs:
  $$
    a_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
    = \dfrac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1}
  $$ 
  where ${v_2}$ is the particle's velocity at time ${t_2,}$ and ${v_1}$ at time ${t_1.}$
- ${a_{\text{avg}}}$ is a vector quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.
- The algebraic sign of ${a_{\text{avg}}}$ indicates the direction of ${a_{\text{avg}}.}$ 

### Instantaneous Acceleration
- __*definition*__. An particle's _instantaneous acceleration_ (or simply _acceleration_), is
    $$
        a = \dfrac{\text{d} v}{\text{d} t}
        = \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} \left( \dfrac{\text{d}x}{\text{d}t} \right)
        = \dfrac{\text{d}^2 x}{\text{d}t^2}.
    $$
    That is, a particle's acceleration at any instant is the second derivative of its position ${x(t)}$ with respect to time.
- Acceleration is commonly measured in ${\text{m}/\text{s}^2}$ (meters per second squared).

### g Units
- Large accelerations are sometimes expressed in ${\text{g}}$ units:
	$$
		1 \text{g} = 9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2.
	$$

### Acceleration Signum
- If the signs of the velocity and acceleration of a particle are the same, the speed of the particle increases. If the signs are opposite, the speed decreases.

### Constant Acceleration
Constant acceleration is a common case of movement. E.g., while stopped at a red light, you accelerate your car at an approximately constant rate when the light turns green.

The following equations mathematically model this case. The equations only apply to constant acceleration.
- __*equation*__. Where ${a}$ is constant,
	$$
		a = a_\text{avg} = \dfrac{v_1 - v_0}{t_1 - t_0},
	$$
	where ${v_1}$ is the velocity at time ${t_1}$ and ${v_0}$ is the velocity at time ${t_0.}$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{x_1 - x_0}{t_1 - t_0}.
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		x_1 = x_0 + v_{\text{avg}}t.
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		v_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_1).
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
  $$
		v_{\text{avg}} = v_0 + \dfrac{1}{2}at. 
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		x_1 - x_0 = v_0t + \dfrac{1}{2}at^2.
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		v_1^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x_1 - x_0).
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		x_1 - x_0 = \dfrac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_1)t.
	$$
- __*equation*__. Under constant acceleration,
	$$
		x_1 - x_0 = vt - \dfrac{1}{2}at^2.
	$$

### Free-fall Acceleration
- If we toss an object either up or down and eliminate the effects of air on the object's flight, we would find that the object accelerates downward at a certain constant rate.	
- We call this rate _free-fall acceleration_, of magnitude ${g.}$
  - Free-fall acceleration is independent of the object's mass, density, or shape â€” it is the same for all objects.
  - At sea-level in Earth's midlatitudes, the value is roughly ${9.807 \text{m}/\text{s}^2.}$

## 2D & 3D Motion
### Position & Displacement
- We can locate a particle with a position vector ${\overrightarrow{r}:}$
	$$
		\overrightarrow{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k}.
	$$
- Suppose an object moves from position ${\overrightarrow{r}_1}$ to ${\overrightarrow{r}_2.}$ Then its _displacement_ is: 
		$$
			\Delta\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{r}_2 - \overrightarrow{r}_1.
		$$
	- Using unit-vector notation, we can rewrite this as:
		$$
			\Delta \overrightarrow{r} = (x_2 - x_1) \hat{i} + (y_2 - y_1) \hat{j} + (z_2 - z_1) \hat{k}.
		$$ 
		where coordinates ${(x_1, y_1, z_1)}$ correspond to position vector ${\overrightarrow{r}_1,}$ and coordinates ${(x_2, y_2, z_2)}$ correspond to position vector ${\overrightarrow{r}_2.}$
	- We may also write:
		$$
			\Delta \overrightarrow{r} = \Delta x \hat{i} + \Delta y \hat{j} + \Delta z \hat{k}.
		$$
		where ${\Delta x = x_2 - x_1,}$ ${\Delta y = y_2 - y_1,}$ and ${\Delta z = z_2 - z_1.}$

### Velocity in Space
- A particle moves from point ${A}$ to point ${B.}$ How fast does it move?
- If a particle moves through a displacement ${\Delta \overrightarrow{r}}$ in a time interval ${\Delta t,}$ then its average velocity, denoted ${\overrightarrow{v}_{\text{avg}},}$ is:
	$$
		\overrightarrow{v}_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\Delta \overrightarrow{r}}{\Delta t}.
	$$
  - We can rewrite this as: 
	$$
	\begin{aligned}
		\overrightarrow{v}_{\text{avg}} &= \dfrac{\Delta x \hat{i} + \Delta y \hat{j} + \Delta z \hat{k}}{\Delta t} \\[1.5em]
		&= \dfrac{\Delta x }{\Delta t} \hat{i} + \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} \hat{j} + \dfrac{\Delta z}{\Delta t} \hat{k}.
	\end{aligned}
	$$
- The _instantaneous velocity_ of the particle is given by:
  $$
	\overrightarrow{v} = \dfrac{\text{d}\overrightarrow{r}}{\text{d}t}.
  $$ 
  - The direction of the instantaneous velocity ${\overrightarrow{v}}$ of a particle is always tangent to the particle's path at the particle's position.
- We can extend this to three dimensions:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
	\overrightarrow{v} &= \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} (x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k}) \\[1.5em]
	\dfrac{\text{d}x}{\text{d}t} \hat{i} + \dfrac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}t} \hat{j} + \dfrac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}t} \hat{k}.
  \end{aligned}
  $$ 
  - This equation can be simplified to:
	$$
		\overrightarrow{v} = v_x \hat{i} + v_y \hat{j} + v_z \hat{k},
	$$
	where:
	<Cols of={3}>
		$$
			v_x = \dfrac{\text{d}x}{\text{d}t}
		$$
		$$
			v_y = \dfrac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}t}
		$$
		$$
			v_z = \dfrac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}t}.
		$$
	</Cols>

### Acceleration in Space
- When a particle's velocity changes from ${\overrightarrow{v}_1}$ to ${\overrightarrow{v}_2}$ over a time interval ${\Delta t,}$ its _average acceleration_ during ${\Delta t}$ is given by: 
	$$
		\overrightarrow{a}_{\text{avg}} = \dfrac{\overrightarrow{v}_2 - \overrightarrow{v}_1}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{\Delta \overrightarrow{v}}{\Delta t}.
	$$
- As ${\Delta t \to 0,}$ the limit ${\overrightarrow{a}_{\text{avg}}}$ aproaches the _instantaneous acceleration_ ${\overrightarrow{a}:}$
	$$
		\overrightarrow{a} = \dfrac{\text{d}\overrightarrow{v}}{\text{d}t}.
	$$
- If a particle's velocity changes in either magnitude or direction (or both), then the particle has an acceleration.
- Instantaneous acceleration can be written in unit-vector form as:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
	\overrightarrow{a} &= \dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} (v_x \hat{i} + v_y \hat{j} + v_z \hat{k}) \\[1.5em]
	&= \dfrac{\text{d}v_x}{\text{d}t} \hat{i} + \dfrac{\text{d}v_y}{\text{d}t} \hat{j} + \dfrac{\text{d}v_z}{\text{d}t} \hat{k}.
  \end{aligned}
  $$ 
  - We can rewrite this as:
	$$
		\overrightarrow{a} = a_x \hat{i} + a_y \hat{j} + a_z \hat{k},
	$$
	where
	<Cols of={3}>
		$$
			a_x = \dfrac{\text{d}v_x}{\text{d}t}
		$$
		$$
			a_y = \dfrac{\text{d}v_y}{\text{d}t}
		$$
		$$
			a_z = \dfrac{\text{d}v_z}{\text{d}t}.
		$$
	</Cols>

### Projectile Motion
- A _projectile_ is a particle that moves in a vertical plane with some initial velocity ${\overrightarrow{v}_0}$ but its acceleration is always the free-fall acceleration ${\overrightarrow{g},}$ which points downward.
- The projectile's initial velocity can be written as:
  $$
	\overrightarrow{v}_0 = v_{0_x} \hat{i} + v_{0_y} \hat{j}.
  $$ 
  - If we know the angle ${\theta_0}$ (the angle between ${\overrightarrow{v}_0}$ and the positive ${x}$-direction), we have:
    $$
		\begin{aligned}
			 v_{0_x} &= v_0 \cos \theta_0 \\[1.5em]
			 v_{0_y} &= v_0 \sin \theta_0.
		\end{aligned}
	$$ 
- During its projectile motion:
  - the particle's position vector ${\overrightarrow{r}}$ and velocity ${\overrightarrow{v}}$ change continuously.
  - But, its acceleration vector ${\overrightarrow{a}}$ is constant and _always_ directed vertically downward.
  - There is no horizontal acceleration.
- In projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of one another; that is, neither motion affects the other.

#### The Horizontal Motion
- There is no acceleration in the horizontal direction, so the horizontal component ${v_x}$ of the projectile's velocity remains unchanged from its initial value ${v_{0_x}}$ throughout the motion.
- At any time ${t,}$ the projectile's horizontal displacement ${x_t - x_0}$ (where ${x_t}$ is the projectil's position at time ${t}$) from an initial position ${x_0}$ is given by:
	$$
		x_t - x_0 = v_{0_x} t.
	$$
- Since ${v_{0_x} = v_0 \cos \theta_0,}$ we have:
  $$
	x_t - x_0 = (v_0 \cos \theta_0) t.
  $$ 

#### The Vertical Motion
- The vertical motion of a projectile is _free-fall_. 
- This means that the acceleration is constant.
- Thus, we may use the kinematic equations, with ${a = g:}$
  $$
	y_t - y_0 = v_{0_y} t - \dfrac{1}{2}gt^2,
  $$
  wherer ${y_t}$ is the projectile's position at time ${t,}$ ${y_0}$ is its initial position, ${v_{0_y}}$ is the ${y}$-component of ${v_0,}$ and ${g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
- Since ${v_{0_y} = v_0 \sin \theta_0,}$ we have:
  $$
	y - y_0 = (v_0 \sin \theta_0)t - \dfrac{1}{2}gt^2.
  $$ 
- Replacing ${a = g}$ with the other kinematic equations, we have:
  $$
	\begin{aligned}
		v_y &= v_0 \sin \theta_0 - gt \\[1.5em]
		v_y^2 &= (v_0 \sin \theta_0)^2 - 2g(y_t - y_0).
	\end{aligned}
  $$

#### The Equation of the Path
- The equation of the projectile's path (its _trajectory_) is given by:
  $$
	y = (\tan \theta_0)x - \dfrac{gx^2}{2(v_0 \cos \theta_0)^2}.
  $$ 
- For simplicity, we let ${x_0}$ and ${y_0 = 0.}$
- Because ${g,}$ ${\theta_0,}$ and ${v_0}$ are constants, the trajectory equation is of the form ${y = ax + bx^2,}$ where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are constants. Thus, the projectile's trajectory is _parabolic_.
