## Position

<blockquote>

__*definition: position.*__ Let ${𝓸}$ be some object. If ${𝓸}$ exists in one-dimensional space ${\reals,}$ then ${𝓸}$'s _position_ is an ${x \in \reals,}$ relative to some _reference point_ ${\mathscr{O}.}$ If ${𝓸}$ exists in two-dimensional space ${\reals^2,}$ then ${𝓸}$'s position is a pair ${(x,y) \in \reals^2,}$ again relative to some reference point ${\mathscr{O}.}$ If ${𝓸}$ exists in three-dimensional space, then ${𝓸}$'s position is a triple ${(x,y,z) \in \reals^3}$ (relative to some reference point ${\mathscr{O}.}$)

</blockquote>

## Displacement

<blockquote>

__*definition: displacement.*__ Suppose an object ${𝓸}$ has an initial position ${x_1}$ and a final position ${x_2.}$ Then the change from position ${x_1}$ to ${x_2}$ is called the _displacement_ of ${𝓸,}$ denoted ${\Delta x,}$ where     

$$
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1.
$$

</blockquote>

Displacement is a vectory quantity &mdash; it has a magnitude and a direction.
