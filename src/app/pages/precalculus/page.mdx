## Functions
- __*definition*__. A relation ${f}$ from a set ${A}$ to a set ${B}$ is a function if, for each ${x \in A,}$ there is at most one element ${y \in B.}$
    - Functions are sometimes called __mappings__. 
- We can denote a function with the notation:
	$$
			f: A \to B.
	$$ 
  - The __domain__ of ${f}$ is the set ${A}$ or a subset of ${A.}$ 
	- The __codomain__ of ${f}$ is the set ${B.}$ 
	- The __range__ of ${f}$ is a subset of ${B.}$
- __*example*__. Below are relations ${f,}$ ${g,}$ and ${h.}$
	<ImageRelations1/>
	- ${f}$ is not a function since one input maps to two elements in the codomain.
	- ${g}$ is a function since each input maps to at most one element in the codomain.
	- ${h}$ is a function since each input maps to at most one element in the codomain. Notice that not every input must be mapped. The only requirement is that an input maps to at most one.

## Affine Functions
- __*definition*__. An __affine function__ is a function defined by an equation of the form
	$$
		f(x) = ax + b,
	$$
	where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are constants in ${\reals}$. 
	- If ${b = 0}$ and ${a \neq 0,}$ we call ${f}$ a __linear function__.
- __*example*__. ${f(x) = 2x + 1}$ is an affine function.
- __*example*__. ${f(x) = 2x}$ is a linear function.
- __*example*__. ${f(x) = {x}/{3}}$ is a linear function.
- __*example*__. ${f(x) = \dfrac{x}{3} + \pi}$ is an affine function.
- __*example*__. Below are graphs of affine functions.

		<Affine1/>
		<Affine2/>
	</Cols>
- __*theorem*__. If ${f}$ is an affine function then it has a constant rate of change equal to the slope of its graph.
- __*theorem*__. If a function ${f}$ has a constant rate of change, then it must be an affine function.

## Quadratic Functions
- __*definition*__. A quadratic function is a function of the form
	$$
		f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c,
	$$
	where ${a,b,c}$ are real constants and ${a \neq 0.}$
- The graph of a quadratic function is called a __parabola__.
- __*example*__. Below is the graph of ${y = 2x^2 - 2x - 1.}$
	<Quadratic1/>
- Given a quadratic ${y = ax^2 + bx + c,}$ if ${a \gt 0,}$ then ${y}$ opens up upward. If ${a \lt 0,}$ then ${y}$ opens up downward.
- Comparing ${u = x^2}$ to ${w = ax^2:}$
  - If ${\left\lvert a \right\rvert \gt 1,}$ then ${w}$'s graph opens up narrower than ${u.}$ 
  - If ${\left\lvert a \right\rvert \lt 1,}$ then ${w}$'s graph opens up wider than ${u.}$
- The parabola ${y = ax^2 + bx + c}$ can always be rewritten in the form
	$$
		y = a(x - h)^2 + k
	$$
	where ${h}$ is the ${x}$-coordinate of the parabola's vertex, ${(h,k)}$ and the axis of symmetry is the line ${x = h.}$ The parabola opens upward if ${a \gt 0}$ and ${a \lt 0.}$
- Below is an interactive demonstration of a quadratic function.
	<QuadraticFunctionLab/>

### The Vertex Formula
- __*theorem*__. The ${x}$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola ${y = ax ^ 2 + bx + c}$ is given by
	$$
		x = \dfrac{-b}{2a}.
	$$

import {VerticalSymmetry} from "@/components/Precalculus"; 

## Vertical Symmetry Testing
- Parabolas are symmetric about a vertical line. More generally, we can test other functions for vertical symmetry.
- __*vertical symmetry test*__. The graph of a function ${f}$ is symmetric about the line ${x = k}$ if the following conditions are met:
	- ${x + k \in \text{dom}(f) \implies x - k \in \text{dom}(f)}$ 
	- ${f(x + h) = f(x - h).}$
	<VerticalSymmetry/>

## Polynomial Functions
- __*definition*__. A __polynomial function__ is a function defined by an equation of the form
	$$
		f(x) = a_n x ^n + a _{n - 1} x ^{n - 1} + \ldots + a _{1} x + a _{0},
	$$
	where ${n}$ is a nonnegative integer and the ${a _{i}}$'s are constants. If ${a _{n} \neq 0,}$ then the __degree__ of the polynomial is ${n.}$
- __*notation*__. Given a polynomial ${p,}$ we denote the degree of ${p}$ with the notation 
	$$
		\text{deg}(p).
	$$
- __*example*__. ${y = 7}$ is a polynomial, with ${\text{deg}(y) = 0.}$ We can think of ${y = 7}$ as ${y = 7x^{0}.}$ 
- __*definition*__. A function of the form ${y = x ^{n}}$ where ${n}$ is any real-number constant is called a __power function__. 
- Power functions are polynomials. Power functions with nonnegative integer exponents are the simplest polynomial functions.
