## Binary Numbers
Internally, computers store information using electronic switches. These switches can be on (represented by the number ${1}$) or off (represented by the number ${1}$). If we can convert a decimal number into a binary number, then we can store that number in a computer. 

> __Definition__. An ${n}$-digit binary number is a sequence

>     (b_{n-1}, \ldots, b_1, b_0)_2

To distinguish between number systems, we will use the notation ${(x_{n-1}, \ldots, x_1, x_0)_b,}$ where ${x}$ is a digit in the number system and ${b}$ is the system's base. For example, the notation ${1011_2}$ represents the binary number ${1011,}$ while the notation ${1011_{10}}$ represents the decimal number ${1011.}$

## Decimal to Binary
### Converting Integers
We convert decimal integers to binary by dividing by ${2}$ successively and recording the remainders until we reach a quotient of ${0.}$ For example, the number ${53:}$ 

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    53 \div 2 = 26 ~\text{R}~ &1 \\[1em]
    26 \div 2 = 13 ~\text{R}~ &0 \\[1em]
    13 \div 2 = 6 ~\text{R}~ &1 \\[1em]
    6 \div 2 = 3 ~\text{R}~ &0 \\[1em]
    3 \div 2 = 1 ~\text{R}~ &1 \\[1em]
    1 \div 2 = 0 ~\text{R}~ &1
    \end{aligned}
$$

Reading the recorded remainders from top to bottom, we have the binary number ${101011_2.}$

## Converting Rationals
Converting rationals to binary is similar to converting integers, except the steps are reversed. We _multiply_ by two successively and record the integer parts, moving away from the decimal point towards the right. For example, the number ${0.7:}$

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        .7 \times 2 = .4 + &1 \\[1em]
        .4 \times 2 = .8 + &0 \\[1em]
        .8 \times 2 = .6 + &1 \\[1em]
        .6 \times 2 = .2 + &1 \\[1em]
        .2 \times 2 = .4 + &0 \\[1em]
        .4 \times 2 = .8 + &0 \\[1em]
        \vdots
    \end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the process repeats after four steps and continues indefinitely. Thus, 

$$
    0.7_{10} = .1011001100110\ldots_2 = .1\overline{0110}_2, 
$$

where the overbar notation denotes infinitely repeated digits. From these last two sections, we see that

$$
    53.7_{10} = 110101.1\overline{0110}_2.
$$
