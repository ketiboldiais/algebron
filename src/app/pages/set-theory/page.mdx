## Foundations
We begin by defining some basic terminology and fundamental axioms.

> __*definition*__. A _set_ is a collection of objects, called the _elements_ or _members_ of the set. Given a set ${S,}$ if ${x}$ is an element of ${S,}$ we write ${x \in S.}$ If ${x}$ is not an element of ${S,}$ we write ${x \notin S.}$

If we want to explicitly list the elements of a set, we use curly braces. For example, here is a set of two elements:

$$
    \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace.
$$

A set is called a _finite set_ if it contains a finite number of elements. A set is called an _infinite set_ if it contains an infinite number of elements.

> __*definition*__. The number of distinct elements in a set ${S}$ is denoted ${n(S)}$ or ${\lvert S \rvert.}$ If ${S}$ is a finite set, we call ${n(S)}$ the _cardinality_ or _cardinal number_ of the set ${S.}$


### The Empty Set
> __*axiom*__. There is exactly one set with no elements, called the _empty set_ or _null set_, denoted ${\varnothing.}$

### Subsets
> __*definition*__. Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ if every element of ${B}$ is also an element of ${A,}$ then ${B}$ is a _subset_ of ${A,}$ and we write ${B \subseteq A.}$

From the definition above, we can see that every set is a subset of itself. Given a set ${A,}$ every element of ${A}$ is also an element of ${A.}$ Moreover, ${\varnothing}$ is a subset of every set ${A,}$ since every element of ${\varnothing}$ (nothing) is also an element of ${A.}$ Given a set ${A,}$ we call the subsets ${A}$ and ${\varnothing}$ the _trivial subsets_ of ${A.}$

> __*definition*__. Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. If every element of ${B}$ is an element of ${A,}$ ${B \neq \varnothing,}$ and ${B \neq A,}$ then ${B}$ is a _proper subset_ of ${A,}$ and we write ${B \subset A.}$

### Equality of Sets
> __*definition*__. Two sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.

__*example*__. Let ${A = \lbrace 1,2,3 \rbrace}$ and ${B = \lbrace 1,2,3 \rbrace.}$ The sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ contain the same elements, so ${A = B.}$ 

Now that we have subsets, we can provide an alternative definition of equality:

> __*definition*__. Two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ are equal if and only if ${B \subseteq A}$ and ${A \subseteq B.}$

From this definition, we see that two prove two sets are equal, we must prove that ${x \in A \implies x \in B,}$ and ${x \in B \implies x \in A.}$ 

### Power Sets
Consider the set ${A = \lbrace p, q, r, \rbrace.}$ What are all the possible ways we can reach into this set and pull a handful of these elements? Remember that sets are unordered collections. So, what we're asking for, formally, is what are all the possible subsets of ${A}$? We have following possible results:

1. ${\varnothing}$ (we pull out nothing).
2. ${\lbrace p \rbrace}$
3. ${\lbrace q \rbrace}$
4. ${\lbrace r \rbrace}$
5. ${\lbrace p, q \rbrace}$
6. ${\lbrace p, r \rbrace}$
7. ${\lbrace q, r \rbrace}$
8. ${\lbrace p, q, r \rbrace}$

The set of all these results is called the _power set_ of ${A.}$ 

> __*definition*__. Let ${A}$ be a set. Then the set of all subsets of ${A}$ is called the _power set_ of ${A,}$ denoted ${P(A).}$

In our previous example, we saw that there are eight subsets. We generalize this result with the following counting theorem:

> __*theorem*__. Let ${A}$ be a set. If ${\lvert A \rvert = n,}$ then ${\lvert P(A) \rvert = 2^n.}$

### Set Algebra
Set algebra refers to the definitions, theorems, and procedures for operations on sets.

#### Intersection
> __*definition*__. Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ the set of all elements common to both ${A}$ and ${B}$ is called the intersection of ${A}$ and ${B,}$ written ${A \cap B.}$ Symbolically:
>
> $$
>    A \cap B \coloneqq \lbrace x ~|~ x \in A \land x \in B \rbrace.
> $$

Below, the purple shaded region corresponds to the intersection of ${A}$ and ${B.}$

#### Union
> __*definition*__. Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ the set of all elements found in ${A}$ or ${B}$ (or both) is called the __union__ of ${A}$ and ${B,}$ written ${A \cup B.}$ Symbolically:
>
> $$
>    A \cup B \coloneqq \lbrace x ~|~ x \in A \lor x \in B \rbrace.
> $$

#### Laws of Intersection & Union
Below are some basic laws of intersection and union.

> - ${A \cap B \subseteq A \cup B}$
> - If ${A \cup B = A \cap B,}$ then ${A = B.}$
> - ${A \cup B = A}$ if and only if ${B \subseteq A.}$
> - ${A \cap B = A}$ if and only if ${A \subseteq B.}$
> - ${A \cap A = A}$ (_Indempotent Law_).
> - ${A \cup A = A}$ (_Indempotent Law_).
> - ${A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing.}$ (_Identity Law_).
> - ${A \cup \varnothing = A.}$ (_Identity Law_).
> - Let ${A \subset S.}$ Then ${A \cup S = S.}$
> - Let ${A \subset S.}$ Then ${A \cap S = A.}$

### Set Complement
> __*definition*__. Suppose ${A \subset S.}$ The _complement_ of ${A,}$ written ${A',}$ contains all elements of ${S}$ which are not in ${A.}$  

### Disjoint Sets
Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets. If ${A \cap B = \varnothing,}$ then ${A}$ and ${B}$ are said to be _disjoint_. Put differently: Two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ are disjoints if they have no elements in common. Now suppose that ${A \cup B = S.}$ If ${A \cap B = \varnothing,}$ we say that ${A}$ and ${B}$ _partition_ ${S.}$ 

### Special Number Sets
Some sets are so often used that they're reserved special symbols:

| Set             | Semantic                    | Explicit                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ${\N}$          | The set of natural numbers. | ${\lbrace 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \rbrace}$                                |
| ${\Z}$          | The set of integers.        | ${\lbrace \ldots, -2,-1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \rbrace}$                    |
| ${\mathbb{Q}}$  | The set of rationals.       | ${\left\lbrace x : x = \dfrac{a}{b}, b \neq 0 \right\rbrace}$         |
| ${\mathbb{Q}'}$ | The set of irrationals.     | ${\lbrace \ldots, -\sqrt{2}, \ldots, \pi, \ldots, e, \ldots \rbrace}$ |
| ${\reals}$      | The set of real numbers     | ${\mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{Q}'}$                                       |
| ${\mathbb{C}}$  | The set of complex numbers  | ${\lbrace z : z = a + ib, ~ a,b \in \reals \rbrace}$                  |

## Ordered Pairs

> __*definition*__. An ordered pair ${(a,b)}$ is defined as
>
> $$
>  (a,b) \coloneqq \lbrace \lbrace a \rbrace, \lbrace a, b \rbrace \rbrace.
> $$

> __*axiom*__. ${(a,b) = (c,d)}$ if and only if ${a = c}$ and ${b = d.}$

## Cartesian Product

> __*definition*__. Given two sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ the set which contains all the ordered pairs (a,b) such that ${a \in A}$ and ${b \in B}$ is called the _Cartesian product_ of ${A}$ and ${B,}$ written ${A \times B.}$ I.e.,
>
> $$
>   A \times B = \lbrace (a,b) ~|~ a \in A, b \in B \rbrace.
> $$

## Relations

> __*definition*__. A _relation_ is any set of ordered pairs.

From the definition above, given two sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ any subset of ${A \times B}$ is a relation. If ${R}$ is a relation and ${(a,b) \in R}$ we may write ${a ~ R ~ b.}$ If ${R = A \times B,}$ we say that ${R}$ is a relation from ${A}$ to ${B.}$ We call ${A}$ the _domain_ of ${R}$ and ${B}$ its _range_. Thus, the domain consists of all possible first components of the ordered pairs in ${R,}$ and the range consists of all possible second components. From the definition of subsets, we can conclude that if ${R}$ is a relation from ${A}$ to ${B,}$ then the domain of ${R}$ is a subset of ${A,}$ and the range of ${R}$ is a subset of ${B.}$

__*example*__. The set ${\lbrace (1,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4) \rbrace}$ is a relation in ${\natnums.}$

__*example*__. The set ${\lt}$ is a relation: ${\lbrace (0,1), (2,3), (\pi, 5.25), \ldots  \rbrace.}$ Notice that: ${0 \lt 1,}$ ${2 \lt 3,}$ ${\pi \lt 5.25,}$ etc.

__*example*__. The set ${\lbrace y = x^2 ~|~ x,y \in \reals \rbrace}$ is a relation.

### Types of Relations
Relations come in various types. We examine these types in the next sections.

#### Reflexive Relations

> __*definition*__. A relation ${R}$ in a set ${S}$ is _reflexive_ if, for all ${x \in S,}$ ${x ~R~ x.}$

In other words, if we know that an element ${x}$ exists in a set ${S,}$ and ${R}$ is a reflexive relation on ${S,}$ then ${R}$ definitely has a pair ${(x,x).}$ 

#### Symmetric Relations
In a symmetric relation ${R,}$ if we know that a pair ${(a,b)}$ exists in ${R,}$ then the pair ${(b,a)}$ also exists in ${R.}$

> __*definition*__. A relation ${R}$ in a set ${S}$ is _symmetric_ if, for all ${a,b \in S,}$ ${a ~ R ~ b \implies b ~ R ~ A.}$

From this definition, we see that ${R}$ is not symmetric if it contains a pair ${(a,b)}$ but does not contain a pair ${(b,a).}$ If ${R}$ is not symmetric, we say that ${R}$ is _nonsymmetric_. The term _antisymmetric_ is a special case of non-symmetric relations, as we'll see shortly.  

#### Antisymmetric Relations
> __*definition*__. A relation ${R}$ in a set ${S}$ is _antisymmetric_ if, for all ${(x,y) \in R}$ and ${x \neq y,}$ ${(y,x) \notin R.}$ That is, if ${x \neq y}$ and ${x ~ R ~ y,}$ then ${y ~\cancel{R}~ x.}$ 

#### Transitive Relations
> __*definition*__. A relation ${R}$ in a set ${S}$ is _transitive_ if, for all ${a,b,c \in S:}$ If ${a ~ R ~ b}$ and ${b ~ R ~ c,}$ then ${a ~ R ~ c.}$
