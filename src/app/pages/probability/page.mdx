## Sample Space
- An _experiment_ is a sequence of operations carried out under specified conditions.
- The result of an experiment is called an _outcome_.     
- If an experiment's outcomes are not predetermined, then the experiment is called a _chance_ experiment. 
- __*definition*__. The _sample space_, denoted ${\Omega,}$ is the set of all possible outcomes of a statistical experiment. Each outcome in a sample space is called a _sample point_. 
- __*definition*__. A _probability model_ is a sample space and an operation of assigning probabilities.
- __*example*__. When we toss a coin, we have a sample space with two outcomes:
    $$
        \Omega = \set{H, T}.
    $$
    where ${H}$ is _heads_ and ${T}$ is _tails_.  
- __*example*__. If we toss the coin three times, then the sample space is:
    $$
        
        \Omega = \left\lbrace \begin{matrix}
            HHH & HHT \\ 
            HTH & THH \\ 
            HTT & TTH \\ 
            THT & TTT
        \end{matrix} \right\rbrace.
    $$
  - The sample space resulting from tossing a coin finitely many times is an example of a _discrete_ and _finite_ sample space.
- __*example*__. Consider an experiment where we roll a tetrahedral (4-sided) die.
  - We can visualize the sample space with a grid:
  	<Tetrahedral1/>
		If we roll a ${2}$ on the first roll and a ${3}$ on the second, we would have the outcome: 
  	<Tetrahedral2/>
  - Alternatively, we can visualize the sample space with a tree:
  	<TetraTree/>
- __*example*__. Suppose a rifle fires at the square target below. We mark the point where the bullet hits. Suppose further that the shooter always hits the target with infinite precision. In this case, the sample space is _infinite_ and _continuous_. 
	<UnitSquare/>

## Probability Axioms
### Events 
- Suppose a rifleman shoots at the target below.
	<BullsEye/>
	What is the probability that the center is hit with infinite precision?
	- It's impossible to hit the center with infinite precision. No matter how close we get, there's always a coordinate ${(x,y)}$ that's closer. The probability of hitting the center with infinite precision is ${0.}$
	- For this reason, we assign probabilities to __events__ rather than outcomes.
		<Events/>
- __*definition*__. Given a sample space ${\Omega,}$ and event ${E}$ is a subset of ${\Omega.}$
