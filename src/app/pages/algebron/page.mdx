Algebron is a math library written in TypeScript. The library provides: implementations of common data structures; APIs for scientific computation, numeric analysis, and statistics; CAS (Computer Algebra System) functions; an API for 2D and 3D graphics processing; and a scripting language called _Praxis_. This page documents the Algebron library.


## Praxis
Praxis is a scripting language built with TypeScript. The language is used in Algebron's library to compile user-defined functions and perform symbolic computation procedures. This section documents Praxis's syntax, grammar, and features.

In the following sections, various REPLs and terminals are provided. For the REPLs: Click to the right of the dollar sign (`$:`) to begin typing expressions and hit "Enter" to execute your expression. Some of the REPL windows have code preset and entered to serve as examples. To clear a REPL, type and enter `clear`. Note that the REPLs are strictly for evaluating expressions. To execute a statement (or an entire program), use a terminal: Type your code, and click the `run` button to execute.

### Basic Number Types & Arithmetic
Praxis supports basic arithmetic operations. Praxis's core arithmetic operations are displayed in the REPL below.

<REPL
  height={465}
  initialLines={[
    { type: "input", value: "5 + 5" },
    { type: "output", value: "10" },
    { type: "input", value: "9 - 3" },
    { type: "output", value: "6" },
    { type: "input", value: "6 * 7" },
    { type: "output", value: "42" },
    { type: "input", value: "15 / 5" },
    { type: "output", value: "3" },
    { type: "input", value: "7^2" },
    { type: "output", value: "49" },
    { type: "input", value: "15 % 200" },
    { type: "output", value: "30" },
    { type: "input", value: "(-7) rem 3" },
    { type: "output", value: "-1" },
    { type: "input", value: "(-7) mod 3" },
    { type: "output", value: "2" },
    { type: "input", value: "9 div 2" },
    { type: "output", value: "4" },
  ]}
/>

We used integers for the examples above, but certain operations are free to take floating point numbers (i.e., "floats"):

<REPL
  height={295}
  initialLines={[
    { type: "input", value: "3.5 + 7.6" },
    { type: "output", value: "11.1" },
    { type: "input", value: "2.5 - 1.1" },
    { type: "output", value: "1.4" },
    { type: "input", value: "2.2 * 5.3" },
    { type: "output", value: "11.66" },
    { type: "input", value: "8.6 / 2.2" },
    { type: "output", value: "3.9090909090909087" },
    { type: "input", value: "3.9^1.5" },
    { type: "output", value: "7.701882886671284" },
  ]}
/>

Integers and floats are considered **primitives** in Algebron. The set of primitives also includes fractions. Fractions are written with the syntax ${a|b}$, where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers.

<REPL
  height={175}
  initialLines={[
    { type: "input", value: "1|2 + 2|3" },
    { type: "output", value: "7|6" },
    { type: "input", value: "1|17 - 2|19" },
    { type: "output", value: "-15|323" },
    { type: "input", value: "3|4 * 2|7" },
    { type: "output", value: "3|14" },
  ]}
/>

### Primitive Types
Primitive types in Praxis are expressions that cannot be reduced any further.

#### Integers
Integers are the most basic type in Praxis. The largest possible integer in Praxis is ${9,007,199,254,740,991}$ or ${2^{53} - 1.}$ Any integer greater than this will be cast to a [big integer](#big-integers).

#### Floating Point Numbers
Floating point numbers in Praxis are represented in the 64-bit format.

#### Fractions
Fractions in Praxis are implemented as JavaScript objects.

#### Big Integers
In Praxis, integers larger than ${9,007,199,254,740,991}$ are automatically cast to big integers.

#### Strings
Strings in Praxis are _always_ double quoted. This syntax is established to distinguish primitive strings from [symbolic strings](#symbolic-strings).

```ts
"a string";
```

#### Symbolic Strings
Any expression surrounded by the apostrophe (`'`) in Praxis is interpreted as a symbolic string. Symbolic strings are Praxis's data type for _algebraic expressions_. Only symbolic strings in Praxis may be passed to Algebron's [CAS modules](#cas-modules).

~~~ts
'2x^2 + 3'
~~~

### Composite Data Types
Composite types in Praxis are data types with an underlying data structure, made up of primitive (or composite) data types. Where primitives are the simplest data types that cannot be reduced further (i.e., atomic), composites are those that can be reduced further.   

#### Lists
A list is any linear sequence of data. In Algebron, a list is written with open and closing parentheses. For example, below is a list with four integers as elements:

```ts
const l = (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

#### Vectors
A vector is similar to a list, except its elements can only be integers or floating point numbers, or expressions that reduce to integers or floating point numbers. Vectors are written with square brackets. For example:

```rust
let v = [0, 1, 0, 1]
```
### Conditionals
Conditional statements can be executed with the if-else syntax:

~~~js
let x = 0;
let y = 3;

if (x = 5) {
  y = y + 1;
} else if (x < 5) {
  y = y + 2;
} else {
  y = y + 3;
}
~~~

### Functions
A function in Praxis can be written as follows:

~~~rust
fn f(x) {
  return x^2;
}
~~~

Since this function comprises just one line, we can also write:

~~~rust
fn f(x) = x^2;
~~~

### Loops
Loops can be written in Praxis in two ways. The while-loop:

~~~ts
var i = 0;
var x = 3;
while (i < 5) {
  x = x^2;
  i++;
}
~~~

or the for-loop:

~~~ts
var x = 5;
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  x = x^2;
}
~~~

## Algebron Core Library
The following sections document Algebron's core library. These are functions exported directly from Algebron, available for use directly in JavaScript/Typescript.

### CAS Modules
[Symbolic strings](#symbolic-strings) in Algebron are interpreted as algebraic expressions. At runtime, these expressions are represented by the Algebron `MathObj` class. From there, they can be passed to Algebron's various CAS (Computer Algebra System) modules. The functions below are exported by Algebron publicly.

#### simplify(u)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj, simplifies the expression. Below is an example of using simplify directly in TypeScript.

```ts
const x = simplify("(1/x) * x");
console.log(x.strung()); // "1"
```

Algebraic simplification, in general, is a difficult problem. In designing a simplification algorithm, there is inevitably a conflict between the user's desired output and the software engineer's preferences. For example, the following mathematical expressions are all equivalent:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \left( \dfrac{\cos x}{\sin x} \right)^2 &~~~~ \dfrac{ \cos^2 x }{ \sin^2 x } \\[2em]
  \dfrac{ \cos^2 x }{ 1 - \cos^2 x } &~~~~ \cot^2 x \\[2em]
  \dfrac{ 1 }{ \tan^2 x } &~~~~ \csc^2 x - 1
\end{aligned}
$$

If we passed an expression equivalent to either of those above, what should the expression simplify to? The engineer may be incentivized to only use sines and cosines. The user, however, may want the expression reduced to any one of these, depending on context. Of course, the more the engineer caters towards the user's preferences, the more complex the simplification algorithm.

#### subexs(u)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj corresponding to an algebraic expression, returns an array of the subexpressions of `u`.

```ts
const result = subexs("a * (x + 1) + 3");
console.log(result); // ['a * (x + 1) + 3', 'a * (x + 1)', 'a', '(x + 1)', 'x', '1', '3']
```

#### freeOf(u,xs)

Where `u` is a string or MathObj and `xs` is an array of strings or MathObjects, returns true if the expression `u` does not contain any of the subexpressions in `xs`; false otherwise.

```ts
const x = freeOf("2x + 1", ["x"]);
console.log(x); // false

const y = freeOf("3a^2 + 9b + c", ["y", "z"]);
console.log(y); // true
```

#### derive(u,x)

Where `u` is string or MathObj representing to an expression, and `x` is a string or MathObj representing a variable, returns a MathObj corresponding to the derivative of `u` with respect to `x`.

Using the function directly in TypeScript:

```ts
const d = derive("2x^3 + 1", "x");
console.log(d.strung()); // 6(x^2)
```

#### numerator(𝑢)

Where ${u}$ is an algebraic expression, returns the numerator of ${u.}$

```ts
const x = `(2/3) * ((x * (x + 1)) / (x + 2)) * y^n`;
console.log(numerator(x).strung()); // 2 * x * (1 + x) * (y^n)
```

#### denominator(𝑢)

Where ${u}$ is an algebraic expression, returns the denominator of ${u.}$

```ts
const k = `(2/3) * ((x * (x + 1)) / (x + 2)) * y^n`;
console.log(denominator(k).strung()); // 3 * (2 + x)
```

#### isMonomial(u,xs)

Where `u` is a string or MathObj representing an expression, and `xs` is an array of strings or MathObjs representing variables, returns true if `u` is a general monomial expression in the given variables; false otherwise.

```ts
const result1 = isMonomial("ax^2y^2", ["x", "y"]);
console.log(result1); // true

const result2 = isMonomial("x^2 + y^2", ["x", "y"]);
console.log(result2); // false
```

#### isPolynomial(u,xs)

Where `u` is a string or MathObj representing an expression, and `xs` is an array of strings or MathObjs representing variables, returns true if `u` is a general polynomial expression in the given variables; false otherwise.

```ts
const result1 = isPolynomial("x^2 + y^2", ["x", "y"]);
console.log(result1); // true

const result2 = isPolynomial("(x + 1)(x + 3)", ["x"]);
console.log(result2); // false
```

#### gpeDeg(u,xs)
Where `u` is a general polynomial expression and `xs` is a list of variables, returns the degree of `u` in `xs`.

```ts
const result = gpeDeg("(a * x^2) + (b * x) + c", ["x"]);
console.log(result.strung()); // 2

const result = gpeDeg("(2 * x^2 * y * z) + (w * x * z^6)", ["x", "z"]);
console.log(result.strung()); // 7
```

#### vars(u)
Where `u` is a general polynomial expression, returns an array of the variables in the expression.

```ts
const result1 = vars("(x^3) + (3 * x^2 * y) + (3 * x * y^2) + (y^3)");
console.log(result1); // ['x', 'y']

const result2 = vars("(3 * x) * (x + 1) * (y^2) * z^n");
console.log(result2); // ['1 + x', 'x', 'y', 'z^n']
```

#### coefGPE(u,x,j)

Where `u` is a string or MathObj, `x` is a string or symbol (corresponding to a variable), and `j` is a nonnegative integer, returns the sum of the coefficient parts of all monomials of `u` with variable part ${x^j.}$

```ts
const result1 = coefGPE("(a * x^2) + (b * x) + c", "x", 2);
console.log(result1.strung()); // a
const result2 = coefGPE("(3 * x * y^2) + (5 * x^2 * y) + (7 * x) + 9", "x", 1); // 7 + 3y^2
console.log(result2.strung());
```

#### lcGPE(u,x)

Where `u` is a string or MathObj (corresponding to a general polynomial expression), and `x` is a string or symbol (corresponding to a variable), returns the leading coefficient with respect to `x`.

```ts
const result1 = lcGPE("(3 * x * y^2) + (5 * x^2 * y) + (7 * x) + 9", "y");
console.log(result1.strung()); // 3x
```

#### expand(u)

Where `u` is a MathObj or an algebraic expression, expands `u`.

```ts
const a = expand("(2x + 1)(x + 2)");
console.log(a.strung()); // (2 + 5x + 2(x^2))

const b = expand("(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4)");
console.log(b.strung()); // (24 + 26x + 9(x^2) + (x^3))
```

#### collectTerms(𝑢,𝑆)

Where ${u}$ is an algebraic expression (represented as either a string or a MathObj), and ${S}$ is a list of generalized variables (represented as an array of strings or MathObjs), returns a MathObj corresponding to the collected form of ${u.}$ If ${u}$ is not a general polynomial expression, returns the MathObj `Undefined`.

In the example below, we define ${u}$ to be:

$$
  2axy + 3bxy + 4ax + 5bx.
$$

The collected form of this expression, where ${S = \lbrack a, b \rbrack}$ is

$$
  a(2xy + 4x) + b(3xy + 5x).
$$

Note that the output string may not look exactly like the LaTeX expression above because of automatic simplification.

```ts
const x = collectTerms(
  `(2 * a * x * y) + (3 * b * x * y) + (4 * a * x) + (5 * b * x)`,
  ["a", "b"]
);

console.log(x.strung()); // a * (4 * x + 2 * x * y) + b * (5 * x + 3 * x * y)
```

### 2D Graphics
Algebron provides an API for 2D graphics. This API only performs the mathematical computations and data processing necessary for 2D graphics. Algebron _does not_ provide actual drawing methods. Any actual rendering on a frontend is left to the user's frontend of choice (React, Svelte, etc.). For example, on this site, all diagrams are generated with React. Documentation of the React components used on this site are found in the [React Components](#react-components) section.

#### SVGObj
An object corresponding to the description of an SVG element.

#### Cartesian Plot
Algebron can generate data for Cartesian plots with the `cplot` function. For example, the plot below is generated with the `cplot` function and React:

<PlotTest />

#### Linear Axes
Linear axes can be rendered with the `vaxis` and `haxis` functions.

<LinearAxesTest />


#### Polar Plot

<PolarPlotTest/>

#### Tree Drawing
Trees can be generated with Algebron's `tree` function.

<TreeTest />

For example, the diagram above is generated using React.


#### Graph Drawing
Graphs can be generated in Algebron with the `forceGraph` and `graph` functions. The `graph` function generates a graph data structure (implemented with an adjacency list). The `forceGraph` function uses a physics-based graph drawing algorithm to position each of the nodes and edges.

import { GraphDemo } from "@/components/Fig";

<GraphDemo />

The code generating the graph above (using React):


#### Splines
Given a set of points, we often want to draw a line through these points. Algebron's spline functions provide this functionality.

import { SplineLab } from "@/components/Fig";

<SplineLab />

#### Convex Hull

To find the convex hull of a set of points, use the `convexHull` function. Below is a visualization of `convexHull` applied to a set of random points, with the resulting convex hull outlined and shaded green:

<ConvexHullDemo />

### 3D Graphics

Algebron provides various functions and methods related to 3D graphics. On this site, 3D models are rendered with [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction).

#### 3D Plot

Three-dimensional plots can be generated with Algebron's `plot3D` function:

<Plot3DDemo />


##### Multiple Plots

<MultiPlot3DDemo/>


### 3D Paths
The `path3D` function can be used to plot 3-dimensional paths.

import {CubeTest, Path3DTest} from "@/components/Fig";

<CubeTest/>

### 3D Function Plot Wireframes
The `fplot3D` function can be used to plot wireframes of 3D functions in SVG.

<Path3DTest/>

## React Components
As mentioned earlier, Algebron does not provide any frontend components or do any rendering. This site, however, uses React and ThreeJS to render the data generated by Algebron's graphics modules. To provide users guidance on how to use Algebron's graphics modules, this section outlines the React components used by this site.

### Fig
Figures on Algebron's site are rendered with the `Fig` component.


export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
    return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>

}
