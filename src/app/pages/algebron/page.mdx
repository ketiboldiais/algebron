This article documents the Algebron library, alongside its scripting language __Praxis__. For the documentation sections on Praxis, various REPLs are provided. Click to the right of the dollar sign (`$:`) to begin typing expressions and hit "Enter" to execute the expression. Some of the REPL windows have code preset and entered to serve as examples.

## Praxis
Praxis is a scripting language built with TypeScript. The language is used in Algebron's library to compile user-defined functions and perform symbolic computation procedures. This section documents Praxis's syntax, grammar, and features.

### Basic Number Types & Arithmetic
Praxis supports basic arithmetic operations. Praxis's core arithmetic operations are displayed in the REPL below.

<REPL
  height={450}
  initialLines={[
    { type: "input", value: "5 + 5" },
    { type: "output", value: "10" },
    { type: "input", value: "9 - 3" },
    { type: "output", value: "6" },
    { type: "input", value: "6 * 7" },
    { type: "output", value: "42" },
    { type: "input", value: "15 / 5" },
    { type: "output", value: "3" },
    { type: "input", value: "7^2" },
    { type: "output", value: "49" },
    { type: "input", value: "15 % 200" },
    { type: "output", value: "30" },
    { type: "input", value: "(-7) rem 3" },
    { type: "output", value: "-1" },
    { type: "input", value: "(-7) mod 3" },
    { type: "output", value: "2" },
    { type: "input", value: "9 div 2" },
    { type: "output", value: "4" },
  ]}
/>

We used integers for the examples above, but certain operations are free to take floating point numbers (i.e., "floats"):

<REPL
  height={295}
  initialLines={[
    { type: "input", value: "3.5 + 7.6" },
    { type: "output", value: "11.1" },
    { type: "input", value: "2.5 - 1.1" },
    { type: "output", value: "1.4" },
    { type: "input", value: "2.2 * 5.3" },
    { type: "output", value: "11.66" },
    { type: "input", value: "8.6 / 2.2" },
    { type: "output", value: "3.9090909090909087" },
    { type: "input", value: "3.9^1.5" },
    { type: "output", value: "7.701882886671284" },
  ]}
/>

Integers and floats are considered **primitives** in Algebron. The set of primitives also includes fractions. Fractions are written with the syntax ${a|b}$, where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers.

<REPL
  height={200}
  initialLines={[
    { type: "input", value: "1|2 + 2|3" },
    { type: "output", value: "7|6" },
    { type: "input", value: "1|17 - 2|19" },
    { type: "output", value: "-15|323" },
    { type: "input", value: "3|4 * 2|7" },
    { type: "output", value: "3|14" },
  ]}
/>

### Primitive Types
Primitive types in Praxis are expressions that cannot be reduced any further.

#### Integers
Integers are the most basic type in Praxis. The largest possible integer in Praxis is ${9,007,199,254,740,991}$ or ${2^{53} - 1.}$ Any integer greater than this will be cast to a [big integer](#big-integers).

#### Floating Point Numbers
Floating point numbers in Praxis are represented in the 64-bit format.

#### Fractions
Fractions in Praxis are implemented as JavaScript objects.

#### Big Integers
In Praxis, integers larger than ${9,007,199,254,740,991}$ are automatically cast to big integers.

#### Strings
Strings in Praxis are _always_ double quoted. This syntax is established to distinguish primitive strings from [symbolic strings](#symbolic-strings).

```ts
"a string";
```

#### Symbolic Strings
Any expression surrounded by the apostrophe (`'`) in Praxis is interpreted as a symbolic string. Symbolic strings are Praxis's data type for _algebraic expressions_. Only symbolic strings in Praxis may be passed to Algebron's [CAS modules](#cas-modules).

## Data Structures
Several data structures are implemented natively in Algebron: lists, vectors, and matrices.

### Lists

A list is any linear sequence of data. In Algebron, a list is written with open and closing parentheses. For example, below is a list with four integers as elements:

```ts
1, 2, 3, 4;
```

### Vectors

A vector is similar to a list, except its elements can only be integers or floating point numbers, or expressions that reduce to integers or floating point numbers. Vectors are written with square brackets. For example:

```ts
[0, 1, 0, 1];
```

#### Vector Class

Vectors in Algebron are implemented by the Vector class in the source code. This class is publicly available. New vectors can be instantiated with the function `vector` (this function is exported by the library):

```ts
const V = vector([1, 2, 3, 4]);
```

What follows are properties and methods of the `Vector` class.

##### Vector.$elements

The elements, or components, of a given Vector are stored in the Vector's `$elements` property. These elements are stored in a JavaScript array, and the elements _must_ be numbers. This rule is enforced because Vector class is also used considerably in Algebron's graphics modules. For linear sequences of types other than numbers, use Algebron's [LinkedList API](#lists).

##### Vector.length

The number of elements held by the Vector is given by its `length` property. This is JavaScript number.

##### Vector.toString()

Returns a string representation of the Vector. This takes the format:

$$
  \texttt{[} e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \texttt{],}
$$

where each ${e_i}$ is an element of the Vector, and ${n}$ is the Vector's length.

##### Vector.binop(operand, callback)

Where `operand` is a Vector, an array of numbers, or a number, and `callback` is a function with the signature:

$$
  \texttt{(} a: \texttt{number}, b: \texttt{number} \texttt{)} \to \texttt{number},
$$

applies the callback as a pairwise operation, taking corresponding elements of the Vector and the other vector. If the operand is an array of numbers, it is cast to a Vector, ensuring the new Vector is of equal length. If the operand is a number, creates a new vector of equal length, where each element is the number.

_Remark._ This method is largely used internally to implement other methods of Vector.

### Matrices

A matrix is a linear sequence of vectors. Expressions of nested vectors are automatically interpreted as matrices:

```ts
[
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 1],
];
```

Importantly, matrices in Algebron cannot be jagged. For example, the following matrix will return a syntax error:

```ts
[
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1],
  [0, 0, 1],
];
```

To implement these jagged collections, a nested list should be used.

## CAS Modules
[Symbolic strings](#symbolic-strings) in Algebron are interpreted as algebraic expressions. At runtime, these expressions are represented by the Algebron `MathObj` class. From there, they can be passed to Algebron's various CAS (Computer Algebra System) modules. The functions below are exported by Algebron publicly.  

### simplify(u)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj, simplifies the expression. Below is an example of using simplify directly in TypeScript.

~~~ts
const x = simplify('(1/x) * x');
console.log(x.strung()); // "1"
~~~

#### Algebraic Simplification
Algebraic simplification, in general, is a difficult problem. In designing a simplification algorithm, there is inevitably a conflict between the user's desired output and the software engineer's preferences. For example, the following mathematical expressions are all equivalent:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \left( \dfrac{\cos x}{\sin x} \right)^2 &~~~~ \dfrac{ \cos^2 x }{ \sin^2 x } \\[2em]
  \dfrac{ \cos^2 x }{ 1 - \cos^2 x } &~~~~ \cot^2 x \\[2em]
  \dfrac{ 1 }{ \tan^2 x } &~~~~ \csc^2 x - 1
\end{aligned}
$$

If we passed an expression equivalent to either of those above, what should the expression simplify to? The engineer may be incentivized to only use sines and cosines. The user, however, may want the expression reduced to any one of these, depending on context. Of course, the more the engineer caters towards the user's preferences, the more complex the simplification algorithm.

### subexs(u)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj corresponding to an algebraic expression, returns an array of the subexpressions of `u`.

~~~ts
const result = subexs('a * (x + 1) + 3')
console.log(result); // ['a * (x + 1) + 3', 'a * (x + 1)', 'a', '(x + 1)', 'x', '1', '3']
~~~

### freeOf(u,xs)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj and `xs` is an array of strings or MathObjects, returns true if the expression `u` does not contain any of the subexpressions in `xs`; false otherwise.

~~~ts
const x = freeOf('2x + 1', ['x']);
console.log(x); // false

const y = freeOf('3a^2 + 9b + c', ['y', 'z']);
console.log(y); // true
~~~

### derive(u,x)
Where `u` is string or MathObj representing to an expression, and `x` is a string or MathObj representing a variable, returns a MathObj corresponding to the derivative of `u` with respect to `x`. 

Using the function directly in TypeScript:

~~~ts
const d = derive('2x^3 + 1', 'x');
console.log(d.strung()); // 6(x^2)
~~~

### isMonomial(u,xs)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj representing an expression, and `xs` is an array of strings or MathObjs representing variables, returns true if `u` is a general monomial expression in the given variables; false otherwise. 

~~~ts
const result1 = isMonomial('ax^2y^2', ['x', 'y']);
console.log(result1); // true

const result2 = isMonomial('x^2 + y^2', ['x', 'y']);
console.log(result2); // false
~~~

### isPolynomial(u,xs)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj representing an expression, and `xs` is an array of strings or MathObjs representing variables, returns true if `u` is a general polynomial expression in the given variables; false otherwise. 

~~~ts
const result1 = isPolynomial('x^2 + y^2', ['x', 'y']);
console.log(result1); // true

const result2 = isPolynomial('(x + 1)(x + 3)', ['x']);
console.log(result2); // false
~~~

### gpeDeg(u,xs)
Where `u` is a general polynomial expression and `xs` is a list of variables, returns the degree of `u` in `xs`. 

~~~ts
const result = gpeDeg('(a * x^2) + (b * x) + c', ['x']);
console.log(result.strung()); // 2


const result = gpeDeg('(2 * x^2 * y * z) + (w * x * z^6)', ['x', 'z']);
console.log(result.strung()); // 7
~~~

### vars(u)
Where `u` is a general polynomial expression, returns an array of the variables in the expression.

~~~ts
const result1 = vars("(x^3) + (3 * x^2 * y) + (3 * x * y^2) + (y^3)");
console.log(result1); // ['x', 'y']

const result2 = vars("(3 * x) * (x + 1) * (y^2) * z^n");
console.log(result2); // ['1 + x', 'x', 'y', 'z^n']
~~~

### coefGPE(u,x,j)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj, `x` is a string or symbol (corresponding to a variable), and `j` is a nonnegative integer, returns the sum of the coefficient parts of all monomials of `u` with variable part ${x^j.}$

~~~ts
const result1 = coefGPE('(a * x^2) + (b * x) + c', 'x', 2);
console.log(result1.strung()); // a
const result2 = coefGPE('(3 * x * y^2) + (5 * x^2 * y) + (7 * x) + 9', 'x', 1); // 7 + 3y^2
console.log(result2.strung());
~~~

### lcGPE(u,x)
Where `u` is a string or MathObj (corresponding to a general polynomial expression), and `x` is a string or symbol (corresponding to a variable), returns the leading coefficient with respect to `x`.

~~~ts
const result1 = lcGPE('(3 * x * y^2) + (5 * x^2 * y) + (7 * x) + 9', 'y');
console.log(result1.strung()); // 3x
~~~

### expand(u)
Where `u` is a MathObj or an algebraic expression, expands `u`.

~~~ts
const a = expand('(2x + 1)(x + 2)')
console.log(a.strung()); // (2 + 5x + 2(x^2))

const b = expand('(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4)'); 
console.log(b.strung()); // (24 + 26x + 9(x^2) + (x^3))
~~~

### collectTerms(ùë¢,ùëÜ)
Where ${u}$ is an algebraic expression (represented as either a string or a MathObj), and ${S}$ is a list of generalized variables (represented as an array of strings or MathObjs), returns a MathObj corresponding to the collected form of ${u.}$ If ${u}$ is not a general polynomial expression, returns the MathObj `Undefined`. 

In the example below, we define ${u}$ to be:

$$
  2axy + 3bxy + 4ax + 5bx.
$$

The collected form of this expression, where ${S = \lbrack a, b \rbrack}$ is

$$
  a(2xy + 4x) + b(3xy + 5x).
$$

Note that the output string may not look exactly like the LaTeX expression above because of automatic simplification.

~~~ts
const x = collectTerms(
  `(2 * a * x * y) + (3 * b * x * y) + (4 * a * x) + (5 * b * x)`,
  ["a", "b"]
);

console.log(x.strung()); // a * (4 * x + 2 * x * y) + b * (5 * x + 3 * x * y)
~~~

## 2D Graphics
Algebron provides an API for 2D graphics. This API only performs the mathematical computations and data processing necessary for 2D graphics. Algebron _does not_ provide actual drawing methods. Any actual rendering on a frontend is left to the user's frontend of choice (React, Svelte, etc.). For example, on this site, all diagrams are generated with React. Documentation of the React components used on this site are found in the [React Components](#react-components) section.

### Cartesian Plot
Algebron can generate data for Cartesian plots with the `cplot` function. For example, the plot below is generated with the `cplot` function and React:

<PlotTest />

The code (using React) implementing this diagram:

```ts
export const PlotTest = () => {
  const D = tuple(-10, 10);
  const R = tuple(-10, 10);
  const xaxis = axis("x", D, R);
  const yaxis = axis("y", D, R);
  const d = svg([
    xaxis,
    yaxis,
    cplot("fn f(x) = sin(x)", D, R).stroke("red").done(),
    cplot("fn g(x) = cos(x)", D, R).stroke("blue").done(),
    cplot("fn h(x) = cos(x) + sin(x)", D, R).stroke("green").done(),
    cplot("fn n(x) = 2cos(x)", D, R).stroke("purple").done(),
  ])
    .dimensions(600, 600)
    .domain(D)
    .range(R)
    .done();
  return <Fig data={d} width={70} />;
};
```

### Linear Axes

### Polar Plot

### Polar Axes

### Tree Drawing
Trees can be generated with Algebron's `tree` function.

<TreeTest/>

For example, the diagram above is generated using React.

~~~ts
export const TreeTest = () => {
  const d = svg([
    tree(
      subtree("a").nodes([
        subtree("b").nodes([leaf("c"), leaf("d")]),
        subtree("e").nodes([
          leaf('j'),
          subtree("f").nodes([
            subtree("g").nodes([leaf("h"), leaf("i")]),
          ]),
        ]),
      ])
    )
      .nodeFn(node => circle(5, [node.$x, node.$y]).fill('salmon'))
      .labelFn(node => text(node.$name).position(node.$x, node.$y).dx(-10).dy(0))
      .layout('reingold-tilford')
      .done(),
  ])
    .dimensions(400,300)
    .domain([-10, 10])
    .range([-3, 3])
    .done();
  return <Fig data={d} width={70} paddingBottom={43}/>;
}
~~~

### Graph Drawing
Graphs can be generated in Algebron with the `forceGraph` and `graph` functions. The `graph` function generates a graph data structure (implemented with an adjacency list). The `forceGraph` function uses a physics-based graph drawing algorithm to position each of the nodes and edges.  

import {GraphDemo} from "@/components/Fig"

<GraphDemo/>

The code generating the graph above (using React):

~~~ts
export const GraphDemo = () => {
  const N = 90;
  const D = tuple(-N, N);
  const R = tuple(-N, N);
  const d = svg([
    forceGraph(
      graph({
        a: ["b", "x", "n"],
        b: ["c", "d", "g", "n"],
        c: ["e", "g"],
        d: ["j", "k", "e"],
        e: ["k"],
        j: ["x", "s", "a"],
        k: ["j", "s"],
        n: ["g", "x"],
        x: ["s"],
      })
    )
      .domain(D)
      .range(R)
      .nodeColor("salmon")
      .edgeColor("firebrick")
      .nodeRadius(3)
      .done(),
  ])
    .dimensions(300, 300)
    .domain(D)
    .range(R)
    .done();
  return <Fig data={d} width={60} paddingBottom={60} />;
};
~~~

### Splines
Given a set of points, we often want to draw a line through these points. Algebron's spline functions provide this functionality.

import {SplineLab} from "@/components/Fig"

<SplineLab/>

### Convex Hull
To find the convex hull of a set of points, use the `convexHull` function. Below is a visualization of `convexHull` applied to a set of random points, with the resulting convex hull outlined and shaded green:    

<ConvexHullDemo/>


## 3D Graphics
Algebron provides various functions and methods related to 3D graphics. On this site, 3D models are rendered with [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction).

### 3D Plot
Three-dimensional plots can be generated with Algebron's `plot3D` function:

<Plot3DDemo/>

The code implementing the diagram above (using React and ThreeJS):

~~~ts
export function Plot3DDemo() {
  const d = plot3D("fn z(x,y) = 4 * e^(-1/4 * y^2) * sin(2x - 1)")
    .paramFn();
  return <PLOT3D element={d} />;
}
~~~


## React Components
As mentioned earlier, Algebron does not provide any frontend components or do any rendering. This site, however, uses React and ThreeJS to render the data generated by Algebron's graphics modules. To provide users guidance on how to use Algebron's graphics modules, this section outlines the React components used by this site.   

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
    return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>

}
